बिहार से हूँ । देशी ग्रोथ हैकर |

Growth, guerrilla and neuromarketing is my forte. Using psychology to hack eye balls and growth. 

Been in this field for a few years. Want to give back to the community. 

Past experiences : AI/3D PRINTING/ED TECH/APP /WEB/COMMUNITY/Worked with reputed authors, tedx folks

Research project: been to IISC, NIAS,  IIITB etc for exploring neuromarketing and applied psychology. 

I believe I have not achieved anything till now. I don't even understand why Neeraj uncle is adding a 20 year and 4 days old kid to this community of big people. 

Probably he wants me to learn more. 

Jai Bihar,

I am Aditya Bose, Founder of ProBano.

Even today when we kids have to make a career choice, they rely on societal stereotypes or parents' unfulfilled dreams. I am sure there is a good majority of engineers and medical science majors here who are into completely different careers now. This is the problem we are out to solve.

ProBano provides online and offline career guidance to high school students in India through an innovative, technology-backed and affordable process. We help the youth of India make the right career choices.

Till now, we have provided career guidance to 9400 students from 110 schools across 9 states. Happy to join any discussion involving edtech. :)

I am Ex-Adobe & Ex McKinsey, that's just makes me a Design Strategist ! Unlike other designers, I start with design workshops, user research's & then identify key metrics to solve for , way before than jumping to the  design solution. With a design background of over 15yrs, I love making things which people love playing with.

Till last year, I & my wife both had a small design startup and it's called " DesignForPeople". We are the faces behind some successful companies like MobiKwik, AgriBazaar, BBL, DBS and more. 

We do design thinking , user experience audits, interface design, IXD  & help startups with their product design and Investor Pitches.

While I am currently leading Bain & Co as Head, Design for APAC region ; Preet takes care of DFP.

It's time to take a step back and THINK!

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

Register Now to Avail!

[03/01/19, 5:32:12 PM] Shubham Jain (pushstart): Hi guys, one of my friend has got a job in a company which has a bond for 1 year, and if she leaves before that she has to pay 1.5 lakh to the company. Is it legal to charge such amount? Does anyone have any idea about what would be the consequences if she doesn't pay the amount? Thanks!
[03/01/19, 5:35:41 PM] Prateek Bagri (ps): Collect.chat
[03/01/19, 5:39:09 PM] Ayush Goyal (ps): Yes it is legal to charge such amount(if she signs the agreement), as companies claim that they have to spend on candidate's training and other expense.

If she doesn't pay then apart from legal consequences HR might see to it that she never gets a good paying job anywhere by giving harsh reviews on phone calls, poor character certificate and tactics of such sort
[03/01/19, 5:45:27 PM] Shubham Jain (pushstart): Thanks Ayush!

[03/01/19, 7:24:35 PM] ‪+91 98716 74274‬: Bonds that are considered unreasonable are not enforceable, and the definition of reasonable can vary. I'm assuming your friend: 
- hasn't been extensively trained by the company
- hasn't received a lumpsum salary advance of around the same amount, as part of the bond (in which case the bond may be legal)
- has a salary in the context of which the 1.5L amount would be considered small/reasonable

[20/01/19, 5:27:05 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): Hello Everyone, I am working on a small tool to print Bank Statement (Savings as well as Current) online. Are there any free/paid APIs (Bank as well as third Party) that would allow access to customer's Bank Statement in CSV format (any other format will also work). At this moment, I am trying to connect with ICICI, HDFC and Kotak. Anyone here who has knowledge of such integrations or can put me in touch with a person who has worked on such a tech.

I guess there must be some sort of eligibility criteria for Banks to allow such integrations. Can anyone point me to eligibility criteria for ICICI, HDFC and Kotak.
[20/01/19, 6:30:19 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): There are 2 ways to it.


1. Like other accounting apps (wave, zoho etc) have a read only access to your accounts. They can read your transactions but cannot execute any. These APIs are provided by the banks.


2. Some apps like the new Cred read your emails with bank account statements and fetch details from there. This is easier to get started bt technically could be a challange.
[20/01/19, 6:34:49 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): With Zoho, the biggest problem is their uptime. They themselves depend on Yoodle and many times do not have clue why their integration with a particular bank is facing problem. I will check wave if they support Indian accounts.

Reading emails is a good idea, quite similar to accessing sms etc but I am also interested in authenticity of data as we wish to print statement. Thru emails etc we might not be always sure about source.
[20/01/19, 6:35:14 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): @919828552997 Thanks for your suggestions
[20/01/19, 6:36:24 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): I use wave for my accounting and for the smaller size that we are, it's pretty good.

It doesn't have certain functions like the payroll etc for india, but the accounting is good
[20/01/19, 6:37:14 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): Are you able to pull statement into the wave account ?
[20/01/19, 6:38:53 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): Oh it does ! Thanks let me see if this can be used
[20/01/19, 6:45:35 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Yes
[20/01/19, 6:45:53 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): I do hdfc and it pulls them all up fine
[20/01/19, 6:47:39 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): Yeah, I am just setting it up for my startup InstantPost. Although it does not serve the exact purpose for me but I can automate my company accounting here. Thanks for the share. +1

[22/01/19, 1:05:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yo Pushstarters,
There is a lot of confusion around whether to add your friends to FB and then here or the other way around. 

In the past 2 weeks, a lot of pushstarters have reached out to me asking *how to add people in their network to this community?*

It’s pretty simple, just share this form with the interested folks in your network, we will add them here directly after going through their profile once 😋😋

Sounds good? 

Then start sharing this registration form with fellow founders in your network:

Been trying to contact you for quite long🤧
[25/01/19, 12:13:18 PM] ‪+91 99719 18300‬: For those who don't know, it's same as "Voter ID No." . Where IRCTC and IA use Voter Card ID ,  EC is using Epic No. I don't understand why different organisations use different terminology for the same thing.. 

This reminds me of Nielson's 10 principles of UI Design, which states the following :

MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD.

The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
[25/01/19, 12:15:38 PM] Shraddha Bhalla (pushstart): Heard a lot about this book! Was on my list

@dipanshu
[25/01/19, 12:23:52 PM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): like you'll get an idea of basic stoicism from my book
[25/01/19, 12:24:12 PM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): which is presented in "sublt art" book in a modernized way, using a lot of f words
[25/01/19, 12:25:21 PM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): for hardcore stoicism, the best books are Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, The Daily Stoic and The obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday
[25/01/19, 12:25:48 PM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): Mark Manson has modernized the basic philosophy of stoicism with the kind of language we wanted to read.
[25/01/19, 12:28:42 PM] Shraddha Bhalla (pushstart): I used to be an obsessive reader. But I stopped reading during my master's, which was for 3 years.

Hey guys. I’m a product guy from Delhi.
Was looking for Product Manager openings in NCR.

As a software engineer turned Product manager turned Founder, I have spent 5 years building next-generation B2C & B2B Indian products & startups from the ground-up, during which I've had 1x successful exit and a few spectacular failures.

Please connect if you know folks looking for a Product Manager.

Budget Clarification:

Only the Rebate u/s 87A has been proposed to be increased to Rs. 12,500 which is only available to assesses with Total Income of 5 Lakhs.

Which means that if the total income of any person is above 5 Lakhs, rebate will not be available and tax will be charged considering the basic exemption as Rs. 2.5 Lakhs.

[01/02/19, 11:30:17 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Hola Pushstarters!

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

[02/02/19, 12:04:03 PM] Sushant Shekhar (pushstart): Any API that lets us find people name from phone number?

[02/02/19, 1:12:58 PM] ‪+91 99785 38243‬: Anybody knows a corporate party organizer?  60-70 ppl in NCR
[02/02/19, 1:13:27 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Isn't its just for authentication?
[02/02/19, 1:22:46 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): I think they have API for checking these details as well. That's all what they do lol
[02/02/19, 1:26:13 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): I guess truecaller won't be your tool if you want authentic information.

Truecaller depends on how people store contacts in their phone.

So if 50 people store @919560124225 as the number for someone else, thats what would show up.
I might be wrong but thats what i know
[02/02/19, 1:27:48 PM] Vijay Rathee(ps): They also have verified name assigned with numbers, when you install true caller and verify your number with OTP, then the name associated is used. even if 100 other people save it from different name.
[02/02/19, 1:32:11 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): That's cool
[02/02/19, 1:33:18 PM] Saurabh Singh (pushstart): May I more details please.?
[02/02/19, 1:34:02 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): So if I save my name as Ratan Tata,  it would show up as it just because I verified it with otp.

Thats still not authentic information and might defeat the purpose
[02/02/19, 1:34:34 PM] Vijay Rathee(ps): that's again the case and you are right.
[02/02/19, 1:39:19 PM] Deepka Dubey (ps): I like the example. 👍👌
[02/02/19, 1:58:43 PM] Smriti Anand (pushstart): FYI only (*Answer from Truecaller employee*) - we do not have any business API which allows people to pass numbers and fetch names, and other details. We do not wish to do anything which the user doesn't know about. Which is why even login with Truecaller is a completely user consent based
[02/02/19, 2:00:11 PM] Vijay Rathee(ps): 👍
[02/02/19, 4:00:53 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Truecaller provides SDK for authentication. Nothing beyond that.

[03/02/19, 1:49:53 AM] Ramneek Sidhu: Hello, everyone! I have a very urgent corporate query. I would be grateful if someone could help with the right connections. 
The prospective client in question has requested the following:
Need to send the best rates for the following:
Oberoi, Gurgaon - CPAI Base Cateogory Room
Westin, Gurgaon - CPAI Base Category Room
Hyatt Regency, Chandigarh - CPAI Base Category Room
Heritage, Manesar--25 Double Occupancy Rooms offsite , MAPAI , All Meal Plans .
They already have best rates with the above properties .
We need to break the rates somehow

Approaching GM or owners, whatever works(usually GMs give the best rates I believe)
Some commitment of 25-50-100-150 Room Nights can be used .We snooze, we loose. 
Very critical to revert by Monday afternoon latest.
   If anyone has the connects for the general managers at the above mentioned hotels, that would be a huge help. Or someone higher with influence. Thank you!

Something's been missing for the past few months in Pushstart... 🤨🤨
.
.
.
.

Rings a bell?? 🤔🤔
.
.
.
Yeah, you're right- It's *#PushQnA.* 😎😎

We're back with an *all new* version of *PushQnA*, starting *next week*.🔥🔥

So what's new?

PushQnA is not just gonna be a QnA session, but in addition to that the host would be sharing *original content* freshly brewed for Pushstarters! 

The content would be shared *3 days prior* to the QnA session and would be *101 themed* pertaining to the topic.

This content is specially for those who are curious about the topic and want to gain some basic knowledge much before the QnA. 

We're excited to begin with the new revamped PushQnA, which would happen *every Tuesday at 9:30 pm* 🤩🤩

Stay Tuned for further updates!!

[05/02/19, 12:19:42 PM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): If a contract is in place, every legal action. If not, not much.
[05/02/19, 12:21:17 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): During their annual filing they will need to mention they have pending payments towards your msme. Just make sure you have raised proper invoice and have proof that the service or goods were delivered. They will be under pressure to pay by their CA in July. If they are able to tackle their CA then probably they are too big for you to chase. Send invoice through registered post as well email with clear terms of payment. All of this matters only if you have proper documentation to proof your case.
[05/02/19, 12:21:22 PM] Akhil Mohan (pushstart): Prove*
[05/02/19, 12:22:27 PM] PG: no no sir, msme act has some provisions... case toh next level hai hi for sure...
[05/02/19, 12:22:46 PM] PG: Waise I have Purchase Orders as well as Invoices...
[05/02/19, 1:14:12 PM] Utkarsh (pushstart): Most CA’s recommend to put that amount in debit notes against any weird reason.
If there are any PDC received from client against supply of goods/service, there is non-bailable warrant on bounce of cheques.

[05/02/19, 7:05:00 PM] Utkarsh (pushstart): Actually debit note is an internal document, it may or may not be shared with vendor.
You can approach them and ask for PDC if they are willing to pay, if not you can sprout some legal actions.
[05/02/19, 7:12:18 PM] PG: No no, it's been an year now

[05/02/19, 8:34:59 PM] PG: @919758344040 i have a question...when you say debit note is internal... aise thode hi hota hai... kal ko main maal mangwa ke, kisi se bhi, aur internally debit note raise kar lu...legally aise accept hoga toh nothing is a better money making business than this...
[05/02/19, 8:35:16 PM] PG: just asking...
[05/02/19, 8:42:47 PM] Utkarsh (pushstart): Yes, it is a internal doc to justify that why you had debited your vendor/supplier (on paper), actual conditions may differ.
Yes, it is not legally acceptable so the vendor has to accept that debit note in case to reimburse the taxes levied on that debit note. 
For a given ex, I supplied some stuff to Landmark Group in 2016 and they have debited 3.5 lac from balance due to breakage issues, after mutual understanding I reduced that amount to 2 lac, they raised me a debit note of 2 lac including VAT, I accepted it and reimbursed my 14% taxes from it.
In your case, they haven’t gave you a debit note, so you have a strong side to present to legal authorities.
[05/02/19, 8:51:06 PM] Utkarsh (pushstart): The thing you just mentioned that ordering from someone and not paying him after that is entirely fraudulent techniques and companies who wanted to maintain their market image and value do not indulge in such actions while on other side people who just wanted to make profit from such activities also exist, therefore it’s always recommended to have a PDC from your client in case of any credit period is defined between involving parties.
As updated earlier PDC (Post Dated Cheque) is a guarantee that you can withdraw your agreed amount on specified date, if bounced then there it’s a non-bailable offence.

[12/02/19, 4:00:49 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Any alternatives to drift?
[12/02/19, 4:01:18 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): That'll allow us to implement conversational marketing, preferably a chatbot or something to capture email atleast
[12/02/19, 4:01:33 PM] Harshit Jain (pswhatsapp): Tawk.to
[12/02/19, 5:09:59 PM] Vanshi (ps): Drift is REALLY good. The speed that they innovate at is something I’ve been super interested with. I actually interviewed there when I was in boston 🤭
[12/02/19, 5:19:39 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Drift is good agreed.
[12/02/19, 5:20:01 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): But the unavailability of anything like a form to capture atleast the emails of the visitors is very paralyzing
[12/02/19, 5:20:22 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Although, Increased conversions because of drift
[12/02/19, 5:20:25 PM] Vanshi (ps): Well, because they are conversational their whole idea is to remove forms.
[12/02/19, 5:20:44 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): It's all useless to me if I am not online to solve the queries right away
[12/02/19, 5:21:04 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Yeah. And that flow is $50 a month
[12/02/19, 5:21:23 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): I guess it's $500 for a bot
[12/02/19, 5:21:44 PM] Vanshi (ps): I’m 100% certain they have a premade bot answer thing.
[12/02/19, 5:22:07 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): That's paid
[12/02/19, 5:22:22 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Ew
[12/02/19, 5:22:24 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Only in the $500/month plan iirc
[12/02/19, 5:22:30 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): This.
[12/02/19, 5:22:37 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Very legacy UI and UX
[12/02/19, 5:22:41 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Lol
[12/02/19, 5:22:53 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Can whats the purpose of chat bot?
[12/02/19, 5:22:56 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): They changed their dashboard. Checkout
[12/02/19, 5:23:15 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Dekhta hu phele kaafi shitty tha :3
[12/02/19, 5:23:43 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): I don't specifically need a chatbot, just something to start the conversation with the site visitors, when team is online and the ability to get back to visitors if offline
[12/02/19, 5:24:22 PM] Vanshi (ps): Isn’t there something called live something.
[12/02/19, 5:24:41 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Intercom is a good option too. Drift is a bit costly but works good. Nhi you sasta jugad messenger chatbot
[12/02/19, 5:30:28 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): No Zuckerberg. Consumer focus hota toh alag baat thi
[12/02/19, 5:30:34 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Intercom is paid too

[19/02/19, 3:36:17 PM] Aashna (pushstart): Is anyone here connected to banks? Need to pick up a personal loan. Does anyone have experience?
[19/02/19, 4:18:48 PM] PG: One more questions to seniors in the group... how do one gets/is eligible for first government tender when every tender ask for prior experience with government...??

also, where does startup India goes when they ask for huge minimum turnovers in previous years?
[19/02/19, 4:21:06 PM] Aashna (pushstart): Companies apply for tenders in sets, also called lead 1& lead 2. Usually one company has the experience and both combine their resources.
[19/02/19, 4:24:15 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Sirji you are sagacious. Shows intellectual acuity. However, I will keep you posted if I can make it.

Thank you.
[19/02/19, 4:35:42 PM] PG: In that case, if company X has experience and company Y has resources, the tender will filled in the name of X. Right?

So even after years, company Y will not be in a situation to file tender on its own. Is that so?

I have a few more questions in case you can help...
[19/02/19, 4:37:52 PM] Aashna (pushstart): The tender can be filed jointly by X&Y. Most government tenders allow for joint filing. It's only in rare cases that they request a single party.

I can help with some questions, the meet should provide more answers tho
[19/02/19, 4:40:12 PM] PG: DM?
[19/02/19, 4:40:21 PM] Aashna (pushstart): Sure

[20/02/19, 10:34:55 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): Hey Guys,
Any innovative idea on brand launch activity in tier 3 cities (like Alwar, sharanpur) ?
Ecomm like brand with TG generally males of 20-35 year age?

Something which can help brand get free PR (Like Flash Mob)
[20/02/19, 10:40:01 AM] Akash (pushstart): Go for a CSR Activity sort of thing. Like Lifeboy did in Kumbh Fairs last year
[20/02/19, 10:41:04 AM] PG: That was really amazing
[20/02/19, 10:44:12 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Ask on fb group too
[20/02/19, 10:50:42 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): okay
[20/02/19, 10:50:49 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): noted
[20/02/19, 10:53:15 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Press release along with a road show is the best way
[20/02/19, 10:54:28 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Depends on the product? Whats that?
[20/02/19, 11:16:37 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): food delivery
[20/02/19, 11:22:09 AM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Referral and WhatsApp Marketing.
[20/02/19, 11:22:32 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): whatsapp marketing dilutes the brand, people get irritated
[20/02/19, 11:22:58 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): What’s the brands name ?
[20/02/19, 11:23:26 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): That's a hush hush🙂
[20/02/19, 11:23:43 AM] Neeraj Joshi: A little bit more abt the brand bro
[20/02/19, 11:23:46 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Too generic
[20/02/19, 11:24:31 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): consider any food delivery brand, swiggy zomato whichever is your favorite
[20/02/19, 11:24:37 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Ok
[20/02/19, 11:24:43 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): need something which can really create buzz
[20/02/19, 11:25:00 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Lol exactly, if you’re trying to sell falafels in Tier 3 you’ll have to adopt a different strategy vis-a-via a Chineese or Indian brand
[20/02/19, 11:25:00 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): and at the same time can help get some PR
[20/02/19, 11:25:15 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): I won’t call them food delivery ‘brands’
[20/02/19, 11:26:54 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s the scene of these brands in tier 3 cities
[20/02/19, 11:27:31 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I think a indepth competitor analysis is a must before you take any  further step
[20/02/19, 11:27:34 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *an
[20/02/19, 11:28:42 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Also riding on a already famous brand is Always the easiest way to get some pr
[20/02/19, 11:28:57 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Think about those lines as well
[20/02/19, 11:29:06 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *along
[20/02/19, 11:29:19 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): Agreed
[20/02/19, 11:31:18 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): These guys are aggregators/ marketplaces which provide food delivery brands an opportunity to sell to their DB
Now are you competing with them or are you a rod delivery brand or a food delivery company providing logistics only ?
[20/02/19, 11:32:35 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): competitors are swiggy, foodpanda etc.
[20/02/19, 11:33:12 AM] Neeraj Joshi: You can maybe create a campaign around the thing which recently went viral
[20/02/19, 11:33:19 AM] Neeraj Joshi: The zomato guy eating food
[20/02/19, 11:34:23 AM] Vanshi (ps): No. Terrible idea. Just no.
[20/02/19, 11:35:39 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): might not work in tier 4 cities. Like in my city Alwar- log thappad wappad mar dete hai😀😀
[20/02/19, 11:35:53 AM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): I have run a similar startup in tier 3 cities and the experience says that people value money more thsn time.

Distance isnt a matter for them and neither is time.

So ppl would prefer going out and gettig it instead of getting it delivered
[20/02/19, 11:38:25 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I agree
[20/02/19, 11:38:41 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I live in a tier 3 city, tried and the concept failed here
[20/02/19, 11:39:27 AM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): yup. precisely the reason why there is no Swiggy and Uber eats in most of those.
[20/02/19, 11:41:45 AM] PG: Depends on product n TG. Can't be generalized
[20/02/19, 11:41:48 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): People don't do food delivery via apps cos either they have a good connection with the place and they deliver for free to you, otherwise you go and get it cos distance and stuff is very less
[20/02/19, 11:42:13 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Nope whatsapp marketing is spammy and gives a cheap outlook
[20/02/19, 11:43:07 AM] PG: We had a very successful campaign for Curry Company, Gurgaon. I've a real life case study
[20/02/19, 11:43:21 AM] PG: Whatsapp marketing
[20/02/19, 11:43:52 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): It still is against the rules and spammy, maybe successful but spammy
[20/02/19, 11:44:24 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): What was the ROI
[20/02/19, 11:44:27 AM] PG: Basics: No Publicity is bad publicity
[20/02/19, 11:44:31 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): And can you help other brands too ?
[20/02/19, 11:44:52 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Lol ! Bad publicity is bad publicity
[20/02/19, 11:44:55 AM] ‪+91 99773 10002‬: I don’t agree to it. Zomato came to Gwalior in September followed with Swiggy in December.

Almost all good restaurants have seen a high increase in sale and people are adapting. Even some restaurants who used to have their own Delivery guys now suggest over call to order from Swiggy/Zomato.
[20/02/19, 11:45:57 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): The reverse happened here, restaurants are not happy even though sales have increased, they feel exploited by zomato
[20/02/19, 11:46:04 AM] PG: 18% average monthly sake increase after 3 to 4 months of campaign.
[20/02/19, 11:46:25 AM] PG: Let's agree to disagree :)
[20/02/19, 11:47:07 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): That is interesting ! Actually
[20/02/19, 11:48:07 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Let’s connect via DM, kitchens on rent has two brands of its own, the masala and the oriental chapter
[20/02/19, 11:48:08 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): But this can be initial excitement and discounts rather than a sustained effort and it could be short lived
[20/02/19, 11:48:12 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Maybe you can help us
[20/02/19, 11:51:23 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Things are changing bro in tier 2/3
[20/02/19, 11:51:45 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @916263485557 @919977310002 would be the best person to tell us about this
[20/02/19, 11:52:09 AM] Neeraj Joshi: And you yourself tooo
[20/02/19, 11:52:12 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): You can't put all tier2/3 in same plate
[20/02/19, 11:52:14 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 😎
[20/02/19, 11:52:20 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes obviously
[20/02/19, 11:52:25 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): That's something I am learning now as I explore more
[20/02/19, 11:52:35 AM] PG: in between all this, has the meetup payment link been shared in the group?
[20/02/19, 11:52:36 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 🙌🏻
[20/02/19, 11:52:46 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Will be shared today
[20/02/19, 11:52:57 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): There are many more factors playing in, especially going tier 4 and lower
[20/02/19, 11:53:49 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): There are super small community based villages performing better than the cities even, in MP there is jhabua and orcha who have done some amazing work
[20/02/19, 11:59:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Performing better in what sense?
[20/02/19, 12:00:21 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Education, Enterprise and overall living standard
[20/02/19, 12:02:34 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Jhabua has over 50% educated males and 40% females, one of the highest for a tribal district. The business economy has drastically changed attracting a lot of investors and so
[20/02/19, 12:14:48 PM] Raghu Nadan (ps): Anyone here into media planning need please inbox.
[20/02/19, 12:19:42 PM] PG: You're offering the service or requesting a connect.

[20/02/19, 12:34:31 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Congratulations
[20/02/19, 12:53:57 PM] Akash (pushstart): Well, I didn't find anyone happy with Zomato Swiggy in Gwalior. No. of orders have surely increased. But what has drastically decreased is NO. OF VISITS to each restaurant/cafe for which he has actually started the Cafe. On the other side on take aways and kitchens are making sales. 

Second, when zomato comes up with offers, 30% is cut from Sellers and 20% is provided by company, food sellers don't find it of any good use. 

Third, on the days like on 1st and 2nd and 3rd jan when there was no offer, there was seriously ZERO number of orders at 90% of the food providers.
[20/02/19, 1:41:33 PM] Jeferson (ps): Hi. 

Does anyone have a ICICI bank account here?

[07/03/19, 11:38:03 AM] Nidhi Tyagi (ps): *Life of an Entrepreneur!*

When I was an employee I used to think, these employer are so lucky, they have no time restrictions, they can come or leave office anytime and we have to stick to time.

They have no  target given by their bosses, who asks them the status on their performance. Aren't they so happy and free from all these being an employer.

Now let's see it from the different angle,

They can work endlessly for their passion whithout being paid when they start a business.

They have to earn their own salary, no one is there to pay them for their efforts. Even for sometime at early stage the satisfaction of doing what they love is their salary.

They have to give a target to themselves so that they can pay us when we achieve ours.

We can be our own master after office but they are still the master of us all 24×7. There is no working hours limit for them. They are all time working with the concern they carry to grow their business, bring more employement, bringing the funds to paying our next salary, staying strong in competition, dealing with uncertainities, giving themselves a new challenge everyday, new targets that may give them many sleepless nights and much more.

#Entreprenership, being an employer, be your own boss, these terms may look fancy but they are not always so fancy as they look.

[08/03/19, 11:56:44 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Hey everyone, first of all a very happy women's day! I run Wicked Broz, a graffiti company. I want to announce something big I'm doing with Wicked Broz by the end of this month. Hope some of you feel it's a just cause and come forward to help us out.
[08/03/19, 11:56:45 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): In January of this year, we undertook a week long trip across Rajasthan upto Agra with a couple of friends from around the world. There was Rikis Santander, a street artist from Chile and Abigail Aroha Jensen, a contemporary artist from New Zealand. We all went mad clicking epic pictures of each other in every pose one can think of at the forts, in the palaces and all over the streets. And the compelling stories of those places made it all the more epic. However, something hit us a few days after this magical trip was over. 
Rikis said two things about the gullies of India - one, they are so crowded (no surprise) and two, there are very few women in this crowd. 

Now that’s not something we didn’t know before. We’ve seen it all our lives. And we even know why it is so!
But maybe that’s why this statement coming from a foreigner missiled into our brain. 
Why? Why is our country so fucked up? 

So we took Rikis’ observation back to Marol, the home of the Wicked Broz, where we’d been planning a hip hop festival for months. Now, we had a new meaning to it. 

Ladies First is a women-led street art festival. The first of its kind in India. Our endeavour is to promote women street artists and in turn bring more women to the streets in India. Back to the basics, dude! Represent. Hip-hop. 

For the first version of our festival that’s going to be held from 25 Mar to 31 Mar, 7 brilliant female artists have come together - 

Anpu, a well known name in the Indian Street Art scene who’s signature cat stencil is always a delight to spot. 
Sam Sam, a part of the first wave of graffiti artists in India who’s been at it for almost a decade now. 
Avantika Mathur, who’s bringing all the boho vibes with her wherever she goes and using surrealism to convey her truth. 
Shirin Shaikh, a solo traveler who’s heart and art are both closest to nature. 
Kesar Khinvasara, the goddess of mandalas whose inspiration comes from the most basic element of drawing - a line. 
Ratna Singh, whose style is all about bringing Warli art to the walls of the world. 
And Abigail Aroha Jensen (yes, the same one we mentioned before), whose fresh, modern style has been a part of the first transgender art fest in Prayagraj. 

All of us together hope to bring more power to the women on the streets, way beyond the walls of Marol and Mumbai. 

What else we hope to do is to bring together leading figures in Indian Street art to come and speak about women, art and their experiences. If you want to simply pick up a brush and get moving, we have through street art workshops for you too! 
And if you want to just come check out the scene and learn a little about where it all comes from, we’ve got screenings and graffiti tours for you to show how art has been taking over the streets for the last few years. 

Wicked Broz has sprung from hip-hop. We can never forget that. So in spirit of that, we’ll also be hosting a cypher on the last day of the festival calling out all b-girls and female rappers! 

Through Ladies First we hope to change the gender representation and inclusion in the scene a little bit, to push the needle against what is considered taboo. You see, nothing is a waste of time ladies and gentleman! 
Shaitani bina bachpan choro, zindagi bekar hai dude. 

If you want to join our movement as a volunteer/ collaborator/ partner/ sponsor, reach out to us at 8887795823 or email us ladiesfirststreetart@gmail.com/zain@wickedbroz.com. 

See you at the streets!

[08/03/19, 8:14:35 PM] Saurabh Singh (pushstart): As we are currently in development phase of KiRaiPe, we are soon relaunching it with more advanced technology and functionalities.

Today, I was sitting in my office and just going through some reading stuff on Google and then suddenly trying to know about me like what Google will suggest or show when I search my name "Saurabh Singh". I know, it was funny to see the results but as an Entrepreneur i look things in very positive ways.
Later on I decided to check the SEO of my website "KiRaiPe", I typed the name and press enter. There were so many things about the company then I shifted my search to image search and I found my teammate pic ANUSHA AGARWAL that was new to me. I clicked on it to know more about the pic. 

I was surprised to see article in the blog of our startup published back in 30 August 2017. In an event organised by YIDS in the auspicious presence of Chief Minister or Uttar Pradesh Shri Yogi Adityanath ji.

Me and my team were so upset that time because of not able to mark our presence concrete at the event but now joy is full on.

Thank you for reading.
