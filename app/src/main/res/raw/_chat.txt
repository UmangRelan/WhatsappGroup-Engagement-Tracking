*Make Sure you Remember these:*
    * It is the responsibility of you all to undergo appropriate legal documentation before going into any kind of formal partnership with any other pushstarter.  

    * Any case of Non-Delivery of work, Scam, Fraud, Harassment etc should be reported to Pushstart Team via PushReporting form: http://bit.ly/PushReportingform. This will help us keep the community clean and maintain the trust among pushstarters.  

Necessary action would be taken after investigating the case which can range from 1st time warning to removal from the community and spreading the word in other communities across India which will lead to your removal from them as well. 

Your reputation is in your hands. Kindly take care of it whenever you partner.

Is there any way that you can send content/file to a client that self deletes itself after three days...??
[22/12/18, 8:53:05 AM] Mohit Madam (ethx): That’s not possible(as the client can download the file/content on their PC). 
However what you can do is send the link to the file which expires after a set time. This feature is available in owncloud and nextcloud(both are free and opensource).
[22/12/18, 9:16:32 AM] ‪+91 70423 36484‬: Try creating it on Google drive and disable link afterwards... But you can't disable him copying the content.

[22/12/18, 10:25:38 AM] Abhishek Mishra (pushstart): Sent file using google drive with permission restricting to View only not download. And after three days delete that file from your drive. I guess this may help.
[22/12/18, 10:27:07 AM] Abhishek Mishra (pushstart): wetransfer is used to sent heavy size file which user can download from a link yoy share. Although the files are deleted after 7 days but still user has already downloaded the files which dont serve your purpose i guess.

[26/12/18, 12:58:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hey Fellow Entrepreneurs,
It's time to take a step back and THINK!

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

Register Now to Avail!

[04/01/19, 2:03:53 PM] Ridhima (ps): Hi,
I am urgently looking to connect with NGO heads across India.
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks! ✌️
[04/01/19, 2:05:46 PM] PG: purpose?
[04/01/19, 2:06:45 PM] Ridhima (ps): I am looking for potential partners for my foundation to collaborate on common causes.
[04/01/19, 2:08:50 PM] PG: As in sponsorship??
[04/01/19, 2:11:22 PM] Ridhima (ps): No no, just partnership in terms of furthering one and other's causes. My foundation helps independent youth candidates run for elections at the grassroots level. These candidates now want to tie up with NGOs in order to bring in change in their panchayats/districts. I am trying to facilitate that.
Further, our advocacy wing works with college and school students to educate them about the electoral process - so trying to tie up with more and more organizations that can help with that as well.
[04/01/19, 3:55:51 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Do you do electoral research as well?
[04/01/19, 3:57:10 PM] Ridhima (ps): Yes, our research wing works on that. However, we will take time before we come out with solid research ouputs.
[04/01/19, 3:57:22 PM] Ridhima (ps): https://youngindia.foundation/
[04/01/19, 3:57:31 PM] Ridhima (ps): This is my foundation.
[04/01/19, 3:58:23 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Does it involve primary data collection regarding elections, from field?
[04/01/19, 3:58:57 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Or is it about gathering a couple of opinions from face to face interviews with popular politicians and activists?
[04/01/19, 3:58:58 PM] Ridhima (ps): At the moment, no. But via our elected candidates, we hope to get primary data more readily.
[04/01/19, 3:59:05 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Cool
[04/01/19, 3:59:42 PM] Ridhima (ps): No, by secondary research - we use government press releases, annual reports and other platforms that come out with legit reports/papers.
[04/01/19, 4:03:41 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Do you have a mechanism in place to verify the legitimacy of the reports/papers?
[04/01/19, 4:18:54 PM] Ridhima (ps): Yes, we do have a process in place. All our work has exact references to public domain information belonging to reliable institutions such as CPR, CPPR, Govt of India, and so on. 

I could connect you to my research wing head and he will probably be able to answer all your questions in detail and to your satisfaction.

[06/01/19, 3:17:02 PM] Shrey (ps): Hello Everyone


At advok8.in, we fund commercial lawsuits between companies/individuals. Till now, we had been relying on third parties to push their fund for investing in cases. In order to speed up our operations, we are now looking to build an internal fund to invest in cases.

I am looking to connect with people who can help in getting a loan for the same purpose.

[06/01/19, 3:20:47 PM] Shrey (ps): Thank you
[06/01/19, 3:21:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: You are seeking loans from bank right?
[06/01/19, 3:21:15 PM] Shrey (ps): from banks or even individuals
[06/01/19, 5:07:23 PM] Mohit Madam (ethx): What’s the expected duration & ROI?
[06/01/19, 5:08:04 PM] Shrey (ps): Pay back period of 5 years interest rate of 20 percent
[06/01/19, 5:10:01 PM] Mohit Madam (ethx): That’s not bad. What’s the ticket size you are looking for? What are the risks?
[06/01/19, 5:12:14 PM] Shrey (ps): We are looking to build a fund of around 5 Cr. 

Our previous model as risky as individuals were putting money in individual cases, thus if a case was lost their money was a sunk cost. however, by building an internal fund we will get enough flexibility to see through those challenges.
[06/01/19, 5:12:54 PM] Mohit Madam (ethx): Can you offer any collateral?
[06/01/19, 5:16:19 PM] Digendra Rathore (pushstart): Do u also need bank guarantees to put up in such cases?
[06/01/19, 5:18:19 PM] Shrey (ps): No
[06/01/19, 5:19:07 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Did you try pitching to law firms?
[06/01/19, 5:19:20 PM] Shrey (ps): Our internal due diligence team properly verifies all legal cases that we fund and the capacity of the other party to pay back is a major factor behind us funding a law suit
[06/01/19, 5:19:47 PM] Shrey (ps): We have ample cases, the challenge is of capital to fund those cases
[06/01/19, 5:20:06 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Yes law firms do have capital
[06/01/19, 5:20:23 PM] Shrey (ps): Also as per India laws,a lawyer can't invest in a lawsuit
[06/01/19, 5:20:50 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Lawyer cant invest in his own case?
He can invest in someone else case right?
[06/01/19, 5:21:42 PM] Jeet (pushstart): And do try to look for debt funding. 
That shall be easier in your case
[06/01/19, 5:22:34 PM] Shrey (ps): Is it possible for you to connect us with law firms for this?
[06/01/19, 5:23:03 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Let me talk to some law firm in my connect and get back.
[06/01/19, 5:23:13 PM] Shrey (ps): Looking in that aspect too, bigger debt funds like Innove Capital only give debt fund along with an equity funding
[06/01/19, 5:23:22 PM] Shrey (ps): Thank you so much!

[15/01/19, 12:59:59 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Removed immediately.
[15/01/19, 1:18:20 AM] Aditi Chada (ps): Recently had an awful experience with the iit bombay E Cell. They r doing the entrepreneurship day there and called to ask me to come speak. As if sharing all this gyan that i acquired after spending tons of time n money was not enough of a FREE gift (given that i have charged bigger organizations for speaking)...can u believe they asked me to spend for my own travel and the reason they gave me "but we r an NGO". I just hung up the phone after calling this unfair. I said sorry not interested. How can these people be so unreasonable or r they stupid or do they think we r stupid..lol
[15/01/19, 1:19:54 AM] Aditi Chada (ps): N the bait they gave me was "all these prestigious names r speaking" and "you ll get great exposure". I told them i already have amazing global exposure..so no thank u.
[15/01/19, 1:57:53 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Apt group will be Mumbai.

[15/01/19, 1:59:05 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Usually IIT Bombay pays for the travel as per my knowledge. Lemme see what had gone wrong.
[15/01/19, 2:07:31 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Let me talk with harsh for the same
[15/01/19, 2:07:39 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Thanks for bringing this to notice
[15/01/19, 2:08:50 AM] Neeraj Kumar (ps): +1
[15/01/19, 2:15:46 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I did. It's a pro-bono as e-cell is an NGO. College don't pay for speakers except travel and accommodation costs and that's also variable based on speakers.
[15/01/19, 2:16:04 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): As it depends on budget constraints
[15/01/19, 2:16:42 AM] PG: Only local cab from n to airport
[15/01/19, 2:18:20 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yeah. It's variable. It's similar across all university in the globe. 
HPAIR also does the same. It depends on budget entirely.
[15/01/19, 3:38:04 AM] Akash (pushstart): Same is my experience with IIT K. Totally bad attitude and unprofessional scenario. In my case they promised travel of all 5 speakers and unfortunately after a successful event they are now no where seen. Some of the organisers are PS members and are there in the community only.
[15/01/19, 3:39:12 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Who?
[15/01/19, 3:39:17 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Can u tag them?

[25/01/19, 11:28:51 AM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Anyone in the group whoz got WhatsApp chatbots? 

We usually call our customers (doctors) in US and more often than not, they are busy and therefore can't take the calls. 

We then email them asking for preferred times and to which they respond back via emails. 

Sometimes this phone tag takes quite a bit of time and becomes annoying for everyone.

I feel a Whatsapp bot could save us by simply sending a message and asking customer their preferred times, which would be easier then emails.


Any other suggestions are also welcome.
[25/01/19, 11:31:30 AM] Harshit Jain (pswhatsapp): Or there are some calendar scheduling applications which require just one link to be sent and the recipient can book an appointment accordingly.

Not able to recall exactly any names but have experienced such things in my inbox.
[25/01/19, 11:33:06 AM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Yeah we tried calendly but somehow people dont tend to respond to anything but whatsapp instantly 😀

[01/02/19, 11:24:46 AM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): We might not know the target audience size. But I still feel they would me more comfortable on thri phone compared to being on desktop/laptop.

That doesn't necessarily need to be an app but if the web is a sort of mobile first, that could help.

[01/02/19, 11:30:16 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Hola Pushstarters!

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

It’s working
[02/02/19, 12:04:04 PM] Sushant Shekhar (pushstart): Any API that lets us find people name from phone number?
[02/02/19, 12:05:39 PM] Sushant Shekhar (pushstart): In India.
[02/02/19, 1:41:40 PM] ‪+91 88028 74546‬: Actually Truecaller does have an API, but not quite sure how does one get access to that. Recently OnePlus did a collaboration with Truecaller to show caller ID for the Indian market on all OnePlus phones. Might help to reach out to them.
[02/02/19, 1:58:19 PM] Smriti Anand (pushstart): FYI only (*Answer from Truecaller employee*) - we do not have any business API which allows people to pass numbers and fetch names, and other details. We do not wish to do anything which the user doesn't know about. Which is why even login with Truecaller is a completely user consent based
[02/02/19, 3:23:13 PM] ‪+91 88028 74546‬: Maybe they've discontinued it, also, the company Oneplus has the collab with, is some Bengaluru company going by "Connecting Mobile Limited". Apologies for that.

A 6 year old report by TechCrunch, stating the uses of Truecaller API, open then to a few paid partners - https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/22/truecaller-api/

[03/02/19, 2:10:14 AM] Ramneek Sidhu: Hello, everyone! I have a very urgent corporate query. I would be grateful if someone could help with the right connections. 
The prospective client in question has requested the following:
Need to send the best rates for the following:
Oberoi, Gurgaon - CPAI Base Cateogory Room
Westin, Gurgaon - CPAI Base Category Room
Hyatt Regency, Chandigarh - CPAI Base Category Room
Heritage, Manesar--25 Double Occupancy Rooms offsite , MAPAI , All Meal Plans .
They already have best rates with the above properties .
We need to break the rates somehow

Approaching GM or owners, whatever works(usually GMs give the best rates I believe)
Some commitment of 25-50-100-150 Room Nights can be used .We snooze, we loose. 
Very critical to revert by Monday afternoon latest.
   If anyone has the connects for the general managers at the above mentioned hotels, that would be a huge help. Or someone higher with influence. Thank you!

[07/02/19, 5:19:24 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Alerts if I'm parking at a wrong place is a better value add I guess?
[07/02/19, 5:19:33 PM] ‪+91 81307 11689‬: Cool
[07/02/19, 5:19:36 PM] Amit Gupta (ps): yes

[07/02/19, 5:20:06 PM] ‪+91 81307 11689‬: But in India its very difficult to find a decent parking space.. 😿
[07/02/19, 5:20:27 PM] ‪+91 81307 11689‬: Thank you for a quick response..
[07/02/19, 5:20:48 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): ValetEz are trying to solve it
[07/02/19, 5:20:52 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Guys*
[07/02/19, 5:24:07 PM] PG: I live in Ghaziabad and work In Noida...

Further, I have offices in Meerut and Moradabad too

1) There is ample parking space in both places...
2) Police are too lazy to tow...I have hardly seen any case...

For me personally, It makes no sense, especially if it is paid...
[07/02/19, 5:25:13 PM] PG: When you say India, I would like to throw light on it barring 6 metro cities...
[07/02/19, 5:25:50 PM] PG: **like you to...
[07/02/19, 5:31:14 PM] ‪+91 81307 11689‬: Yes, you guys are right. I should have said metro cities..

[07/02/19, 5:32:40 PM] ‪+91 81307 11689‬: Utkarsh can you share your website?
[07/02/19, 5:33:41 PM] ‪+91 88028 74546‬: In Gurgaon and Delhi, this would be a wonderful idea. Not sure what one can do once it starts getting towed though.
[07/02/19, 5:34:35 PM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: Yes this will be a good solution for metro/cosmopolitan cities n few towns like coimbatore, Jamshedpur, patiala
[07/02/19, 5:49:36 PM] ‪+91 81307 11689‬: Cool. If you come up with an idea do let me know on personal message

[09/02/19, 12:02:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hmm
[09/02/19, 12:04:07 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s the conversion rate on LinkedIn?
[09/02/19, 12:05:22 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): +1
[09/02/19, 12:05:50 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Also average time to conversion?
[09/02/19, 12:06:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Pushstarters post here to improve both of those
[09/02/19, 12:06:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Reaching out to LinkedIn is like no brainer bhai
[09/02/19, 12:07:16 PM] PG: I get reply, given the fact you approach somebody oh that stature which interests him... Nobody is free for charity.. there are lakhs of people trying to approach them... Follow AIDA model of communication...
[09/02/19, 12:08:01 PM] PG: M not against posting here... Infact better if you've a head start
[09/02/19, 12:08:27 PM] PG: But just that you'll still need compelling content to take it ahead
[09/02/19, 12:09:14 PM] PG: Many, young blood I've have found are under an impression that we'll get a connect and things will work out
[09/02/19, 12:09:40 PM] PG: Meanwhile, nothing related to Mr @919619150915
[09/02/19, 12:13:20 PM] Neeraj Joshi: This group is meant for this bro. Get u the connect u are looking forward to through a referral network
[09/02/19, 12:13:32 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Although we are just 200 folks in this group
[09/02/19, 12:14:16 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Our combined network is more than 10k+ even if I consider every one is connected to average 50 peeps
[09/02/19, 12:14:55 PM] Neeraj Joshi: But that’s not the case here as few of the pushstarters combined will create a network of more than 50k
[09/02/19, 12:14:56 PM] Neeraj Joshi: :)
[09/02/19, 12:15:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The networkers/ecosystem builders/influencers
[09/02/19, 12:15:43 PM] PG: Respect that
[09/02/19, 12:16:21 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So rather than redirecting folks to LinkedIn
[09/02/19, 12:16:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Try helping them is what I would suggest
[09/02/19, 12:16:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Not related to this case
[09/02/19, 12:16:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: But in general :)
[09/02/19, 1:13:23 PM] PG: Is paydeck.in safe? Any cheaper alternate to it? Paying 1L+ to a vendor by credit card...

[24/02/19, 1:46:44 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): Hi everyone, Looking for an advise, how do you prove your Software product is "Made in India"? What could be a legit proof / certification?
[24/02/19, 2:11:28 PM] Nikhil Sacheva (ps): You can just write it as made in india. 
Market it under indian company.
Max you can do is, take iso certificate from india or register yoursef in startup india
[24/02/19, 2:14:26 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): Thank you, That's more of a self-certification of the product, and registration of Company in India, we have all of these, but still doesn't prove that the software was developed in our office.
[24/02/19, 7:39:53 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): With so much advancements in technology, you simply cannot prove that.
There might be cases when you are sitting in an Indian office connected to an office outside india via vpn and coding there.
A lot of variables.

Plus. Who cares where its made ?
[24/02/19, 7:49:30 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): Hi Thanks, yes we can't yet. We are competing with a Foreign Company and besides all the features being better, we still have to have a verified aspect to move us up on priority, one of which is being made in India!
[24/02/19, 7:51:17 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Company registered in India
Office located in India.

The additional aspect that yucan submit is list down the developers who worked on it to show that its an effort from India.

That should be it I guess
[24/02/19, 7:52:26 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): Thank you, we have an additional approval certificate from a Recognised Organisation which mentions our company name as manufacturer, but still that cannot be proved if all the work is done in India
[24/02/19, 9:14:56 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Depends on who you need it proven to and what ar their demands
[25/02/19, 9:11:59 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Yo Pushstarters!

[04/03/19, 6:56:05 PM] ‪+91 84000 09629‬: Hey Folks,
We created a product, Meeve which helps you discover events or activities happening hyper-locally or in a 3/5km radius around you. 

I invite you all to try it out. You can use it for organising entrepreneur meetings, parties, teaching session (cooking, music, dance), business events, gaming session get-together and many more. You get the gist. 

You can only discover people through events and not via search. We have also added ample features to filter out your target audience for your event or activity. For eg: there can be women/men only event. 

Since it's hyperlocal it needs people around you to work and if you are the only one using it you will find everything empty unless you go to discover tab.

Give it a try. Looking forward to your feedback & suggestions.

[04/03/19, 7:28:44 PM] Gitanjali (ps): Can we put our ggn event in it.
[04/03/19, 7:36:40 PM] ‪+91 84000 09629‬: Yes

[04/03/19, 7:43:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: How are you setting supply of events?
[04/03/19, 7:52:38 PM] ‪+91 84000 09629‬: As of now, we are creating events ourselves and getting a few event creators to help us in a community. But in general we don't want to get into or keep doing the event organising. We want to focus on providing the best platform to facilitate the same.
[04/03/19, 7:53:39 PM] ‪+91 84000 09629‬: Events as such are nothing big or fancy. It can be as small as finding someone to eat momos from a new stall nearby to meeting all entrepreneurs around you in a cafe on a Sunday afternoon.
[04/03/19, 7:54:05 PM] ‪+91 84000 09629‬: Or bringing all cricket/football fans around you together to watch a match.

[07/03/19, 8:37:28 PM] ‪+91 70654 31752‬: Hello Pushstarters

I'm Mudit Srivastava and I'm a marketing guy. I've strategized marketing for a Kalaari-funded B2B startup and have worked with a Noida based coworking as a community manager. I have also led the E Cell at my college and have worked with Ah! Ventures and Delhi Angels for marketing their business conclaves. 
Last year I tried to build a SaaS business with my cofounder who had worked with the developers of Ruby, but it did not go very well. However currently I'm in my final year of graduation. And I'm working with my twin brother to build a low cost solution for the semi paralyzed. Last week I was awarded at IIT Delhi for my product. 
Apart from this, I love doing courses and reading more about marketing and its various aspects. I have some experience in event and operations management. But I specialise in content, branding and marketing strategy.

I'm looking forward to exchanging synergy with you all. Cheers!
