[27/05/18, 11:16:03 PM] Nazeeb (pushstart): Hey guys, this is Nazeeb. Sorry for missing today’s session got stuck with last minute work. 
I am working on a venture in travel industry where we help travellers connected to local person anywhere in the world. Currently available in 210 cities worldwide. More of curated couchsurfing model. 
Beside this we have designed some unique experiences and activities through these verified locals in 50+ cities which we are expanding slowly. 

I wanted to join the session to sort lot of issues I am facing 
1. better way to communicate my brand to audience, which is more of teaching people not to go for ore defined tours and packages instead book activists find a local and have fun.
2. Digital prescence over the Internet with low budgets as we are still figuring out funds and almost at closure of that
3. Getting right people in the team, we are three Cofounder’s, me looking after tech and other two operations and business side. I am looking for someone who is passionate traveller and a guru of digital marketing. 

Ahhh there is too much to ask and too much issues I am definitely coming in the next meet. 
Please suggest me your views. You can check our website leamigo.com 
Android app is ok playstore with same name 

Thanks in anticipation

@919975715336 I downloaded your app but it doesn't serve my pincode 400615, can you arrange for the same? Request from a potential customer! 
@918953881643 I liked your story and the grit and determination you have... Keep up the spirit... Entire group can benefit a lot from your networking and writing skills... Keep doing the good stuff...
@917041388878 liked your idea, would definitely like to visit one of your outlets in near future... All the very best for scaling up.
@918277299699 Mr. VC, I liked the feedback you gave to everyone. Your own ideas also hold a lot of potential. Find that man with 6 fingers soon... I liked your tenacity. Good luck to you.
@917977088434 @917715940092 I liked the jeans product very much, would definitely like to be one of your early customers once you launch... Let me know if you guys wanna see that LED t shirt that we discussed. 
@919867617649 I liked your idea. Do create a skeleton for the website and share on the group for the feedback. Looking forward to see a  behance like website being created for the content industry.
@919867708927 a go to site on keto is good concept, create a website layout and funnels for capturing leads... And don't forget mine and Ameet's royalty once you scale it big... 
@Qareerwale good concept, just flesh it out properly and stay away from areas of legal turbulence. This idea can scale real big. Collaboration and alliances is the way forward for you...
@all others, your contacts are not added on my phone yet so can't identify you individually but you all make this meetup a thriving one so keep up the engagement... 
I will share the name of my new startup soon... stay tuned....
Onwards and Upwards guys... Cheers!

What features in the website/app are a must have for you?

For example, I really like the filters which Flipkart provides for Apparel shopping. Also, I hate how Jabong app is always showing me discounts before anything else.

So what makes you like an E-Commerce, even though you may not use it?

[11/06/18, 7:41:30 PM] Hardik Solanki (pushstart): Can u explain in details?
[11/06/18, 8:10:05 PM] Nivedita Kalla (ps): Hi Hardik , sure. 

1. The story starts with myself. Studied at Warwick and Imperial and was a fellow at MIT. 

2. Worked in business strategy in Hong Kong, Mumbai and Hyderabad  but kept helping friends and family with admissions abroad. 

3. Know the struggles that kids face during and after they finish college abroad at any level. Hence wanted to create a programme that equips them for same. From making a competitive profile ( resume if you may) that will aid them for internships and jobs once they are there to the psychological strength building aspects. 


4. I don't get paid by any university (ie not an agent) and I only take 30 students per year. 

5. Once someone signs on with me, I work actively with them till they get admissions to colleges. And passively for all years they are there. 

6. Developed programme after months of interviews with ex-deans of admissions, international college counsellors, students currently abroad, their parents, immigrations lawyers , psychologist, nutritionist. 

7. Worked with students in gaining admissions to Cornell U , U of Toronto, Cambridge, Imperial, HKU amongst others. (This was whilst I was still working in a job but helping friends and family out , moved full time into this recently) 

That's it :)

Recently I messaged here searching for an internship for a friend. I got 3-4 responses and that was amazing. 

So currently, I am working with WorkTeen (there are 3 people) which helps high school students find research/volunteering/internship opportunities. We are launching after 1 and a half years with a new website and currently building an app. We really really want startup founders, and especially from Mumbai to list their opportunities. 

Here is the form: https://goo.gl/forms/uFdrNgRSmKkdpN0E2
If you are very lazy to fill up the form, as Neeraj suggested,😅 you can feel free to reach out to me. 

We are going to have our own interface, similar to Internshala, very soon. Sorry for the boring Google Form,

2. To get well connected.

[20/06/18, 6:54:06 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Let's connect on pm?
[20/06/18, 7:04:20 PM] ‪+91 70204 33632‬: *Main requirement :*

An incubator should incubate students in there idea stage startup.

Like Most of top incubators around Mumbai (IAN, Unltd) don't incubate students.

*We would loved to have these :*

There main focus should be around tech startups

They should be around dadar area so we can dedicate more time

And some successful stories in app based startups
[20/06/18, 7:05:58 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Can u search them online and give me some names?

[21/06/18, 6:51:36 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): This is the 8th year of the Anjani Mashelkar Inclusive Innovation Award
that had been set up in the memory of R A Mashelkar's late mother, who always persuaded him to use science and technology for the benefit of the needy- especially the poor. They have had great winners in the previous years, more information is available at- https://lnkd.in/fcSDvDi

This award presents an opportunity to spur and fuel innovation for the benefit of the most disadvantaged sections of society in order to ‘include’ them into the mainstream. It also has another equally important aim: to sensitize innovators about the problems faced by such sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.

The awardees will preferably be those who believe in not just ‘best practices’, but ‘next practices’. Most importantly, it will value solutions that represent ‘affordable excellence’, breaking the myth that ‘affordability’ and ‘excellence’ cannot go together.
As the award grows in stature and gains national recognition, it will endeavour to leverage support for the innovator from various other private and public sector organizations.

Criteria-
Only Indian organizations or persons of Indian origin are eligible to apply.
Innovators of all ages may apply.
The nominations should be for prototypes or proof of concepts which have the potential to be successful innovations. Raw ideas will not be considered.
The prototypes, products, services or business models should be original and novel.
They should provide highest quality affordable products and experiences to the resource poor people.
The innovations should substantially and positively affect the quality of life of the disadvantaged sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.
All applications should clearly explain the innovation, the originality of the idea, its benefit, and impact.

Recently would like to launch digital marketing based android/ios platform. For the IOS or android app development, third party companies are charging approx 1.5lac. Got quote from freelancers as well with 10k-50k budget.  All companies are well known nd reliable companies. Will that amount is worthy for this job? Any lead is highly appreciable. Thanks.

[22/06/18, 5:22:52 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Hello guys Harshal Shroff here, After running and exiting my operations of 18 outlets and retaining the brand of This Corn,I visited my home town(Chinchani in Palaghar district) after 8yrs of living in Mumbai, I see that not much has changed here apart from the fact that people consume more data(Due to JIO and the current data based marketing) on their phone and are slowly getting aware about "The power of internet and connected lives" it's more like electricity, which still has power cuts in many rural areas. It's been a overwhelming experience of starting up once and humbling to exit and start once again.

However, Schools and bussiness dont see the value of data connections, and even if they do.. complete connectivity becomes an issue due to unstable Network performance.

In the comming one month i am LOOKING to connect and speak with people interested to build multilingual and affordable ways to bring 4G/5G broadband and connect applications to Rural India with "wireless street level WIFI connectivity, based on renewable POWER solutions to effective ways to deliver digital access to people with incomes less than 10k/month

If you are interested or are connected to people/startups who focus on this area do help me connect, we are also looking to connect with affordable Telecom equipment manufacturers and Network infrastructure creators.

Ideally ex-employees of companies like Telenor india, Storeking,Airjaldi,Aervoyce, Wifi Dababa, Digital empowerment foundation or people in the government helping digital india movement in the RURAL areas

Currently we are preparing to build an application for applying for a CLASS A or a Unified, Virtual Network Operator (VNO) licence.

Our Aim is to build
-Robust cheap wireless street level connectivity infrastructure
-Delivering NEW experiences and products to Rural India in affordable ways
- Delivering sachet(Under 50INR) size data,learning,insurance and investment solutions.

[23/06/18, 12:24:50 AM] Arjun (pushstart): Hi guys. Does anyone know a solution/alternative to plastic envelopes for e commerce order delivery? Paper usually tears and doesn’t give protection to the address details.
[23/06/18, 12:24:59 AM] Arjun (pushstart): ‎This message was deleted.
[23/06/18, 12:26:22 AM] Nishchay (pushstart): And the huge boxes they are using is also not environment friendly, people don't give for recycling and usually dump them
[23/06/18, 11:35:57 AM] Hitmay Mutha (pushstart): Using craft papers envelope would be a better option. I have used many times. (Very Good Strength and looks good as well)

But slightly expensive. And can be easily recycled. 

Can make you in contact with the one who manufactures.
[23/06/18, 11:36:15 AM] Arjun (pushstart): Sure will help
[23/06/18, 11:36:44 AM] Hitmay Mutha (pushstart): Sharing you the contact on PM!

[23/06/18, 12:20:53 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I used it 1 year back. But was wondering whether anyone uses it now for doing some productive work
[23/06/18, 12:22:01 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Depends on sector to sector, Snapchat is most used by video content companies and celebs or people to build their personal brand.
[23/06/18, 12:22:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Either build their brand or get business. Have heard artists uses it a lot
[23/06/18, 12:22:29 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Some companies  use it for ads as well
[23/06/18, 12:22:54 PM] Neeraj Joshi: For getting business. A friend of mine got a lot of clients from posting her stuff on snapchat. She is a painter
[23/06/18, 12:35:50 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Snapchat works great if you have visual content/ product. That's why it is a very effective channel for artists, models, lifestyle brands

[23/06/18, 10:28:14 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): I'm going to the quora meetup tomorrow, will anyone from here be there?
[23/06/18, 10:28:38 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: What’s the meetup about ?
[23/06/18, 10:30:29 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Following.
[23/06/18, 10:31:12 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): I'll post a link..
[23/06/18, 10:31:41 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): https://m.facebook.com/quoramumbai/?ref=bookmarks
[23/06/18, 10:33:17 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): 100 or so people expected, many of whom are graduates, or in some startup, or joined some job. A few of the organizers have their own sites, companies etc.
[23/06/18, 10:34:38 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): It's at 91 springboards in andheri, 2:30 onwards.
[23/06/18, 10:38:32 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): It ll be chaos.
We did the quora meetup in a park
[23/06/18, 10:38:48 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): @918953881643 you can get exposure to foreign admits due to the students there, they record the sessions. Bring your own cam just incase 😆

@919867617649 one of the organizers has a company which helps in launching ICOs

@918277299699 I don't know how you'll benefit from it, they aren't pitching ideas, it's just a casual get together.
[23/06/18, 10:41:35 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): I went there last year, they book the 91 springboard top floor through the day and usually chill there and chat for long afterwards.

Definitely Not a pushstart caliber kinda thing. But something simple so I'm going there for tp and a few connections to coders, designers, writers, etc. 

Your choice. 🙂
[23/06/18, 10:42:37 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Yeah its good for connections! Made a lot of good friends there :D
[23/06/18, 10:44:00 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): 🤘🙂
[23/06/18, 10:45:32 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): @919867708927 He he. I'm not into work mode on weekends bro. But tell me more, what exactly is the agenda of meetups ?
[23/06/18, 10:45:34 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I don't invest in Ideas. I invest info strategy which we won't find in meetups.
[23/06/18, 10:46:32 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Whenever we don’t have a pushmeetup, we can have some kind of chilled out meetups on weekends?
[23/06/18, 10:46:35 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s day?
[23/06/18, 10:46:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *say
[23/06/18, 10:46:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Who all will be in?

[23/06/18, 10:48:52 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): Right. Hence it's a waste of time, though I'll connect you with that guy Hussain, he's into blockchain tech and crypto, you guys should chat if you haven't already.
[23/06/18, 10:49:07 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): Waste of time for you.**

[23/06/18, 10:56:16 PM] Yash Zansar (pushstart): Well I only know basic info, I'm not handling the tech in the ico I'm working with.

[24/06/18, 12:40:41 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): But silicon valley was fantastically made, somehow I belive HBO has cracked the conetent game.
[24/06/18, 12:47:53 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: naah
[24/06/18, 12:48:12 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: there are very few shows that are doing well on HBO
[24/06/18, 12:48:35 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: abc network has a lot more successful shows
[24/06/18, 12:49:01 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: and did you just forget netflix? :P
[24/06/18, 12:53:31 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Netflix ofcourse is a distrution play, my point was about conetent production and talent.

Netflix and Amazon started spending on production couple of years back. Less than 4 if I am not wrong...

HBO, ABC or showtime have had some GREAT content. 

Netflix/prime works most cause internet lacks the traditional TV/Cinema censorship.
[24/06/18, 12:53:44 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Personal views.
[24/06/18, 12:53:56 PM] Anshu (pushstart): Thank you Ishan..will connect with you to understand it

Step 3- Dont login. Use guest account if want discount instead of cashback.

[28/06/18, 9:46:17 AM] Neeraj Joshi: In spite of Rains 40 pushstarters have registered for the PushParty 2 days from launch, 😍😍

We are expecting a minimum of 50 for the party. 🔥🔥

If you are still thinking whether to come or not, don’t think tooooo much peeps. Trust me you won’t be getting this like-minded audience to interact with anywhere else. ☺☺

Not only that, we are giving you a stage to share your idea/startup with 50 pushstarters online and 12k+ online. 🤠🤠

Its ok, you are interacting online on the Whatsapp or FB group, but the real thing is offline peeps. 

There is no point in being in any community if you are not meeting its members offline.

[30/06/18, 9:51:54 AM] Neeraj Joshi: [Long Read] - Invite for Social Samosa's LIVE Conference

The team at Social Samosa is excited to pay a tribute to the medium which is a driving factor for the evolution, existence and sustenance of quite a lot of Brands, Agencies, Publishers, Platforms, and Creators!

When we set out to recreate the #SMLive Magic this year, I was told 8 Million People and 2 Lac+ Video Views were possible in 2017 and it's a tough nut to crack considering the friendly NewsFeed algorithm.

As ambitious as it may sound, riding high in the faith and power of our community of Marketers, Agency Professionals, Creators, and Practitioner we are all set to take the challenge and breach the circles of virality with #SMLive2018

We plan to kick-start the day with a Keynote Address from one of the pioneers in Indian Advertising and Marketing Industry - Mr. Ashish Bhasin

Taking the baton from him C-Suite Advisor and Power Influencer - Tanvi Gautam will take us through the essentials of Building an Authentic Personal Brand on Social Media

Anoushka Adya, Rashi Ray and Mounica Tata DoodleODrama will discuss on how Social Media has emerged as a great tool to enable Women Empowerment

This is just the beginning; next up we have Kainaz Karmakar  and Harshad Rajadhyaksha from the team which managed to win Ogilvy India's first CANNES Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness this year with Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks. They will speak about the LITTLE they know about Great Advertising!

A lot has been spoken about the various applications of Data across, Ashish Tiwari will share a different perspective on Data-Driven Storytelling to craft the right message

Chandramohan Mehra from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will bring in the flavor of Hyper Current and Topical Content with anecdotes from their collaboration with Dabbu The Dancer aka The Dancing Uncle

Threading thoughts from being responsive and customer-centric at all points in time, Vineet Singh will share Quick Social CRM Hacks to win over audiences

Mr. Bean from the Indian Digital Industry, Nitin Bhatia will enunciate the importance and relevance of Data in the value chain

Shifting Gear towards some Creator Tales, Ranveer Allahbadia - The Beer Biceps will share his story on carving a niche amongst the content clutter

The Master Storyteller behind some of the most engaging original content from Kingfisher, Sandeep Balan will draw parallels between Branded Content and Original Content

Over the past few years, Wittyfeed has become one of the largest Viral Content Companies and Parveen Singhal will share Growth Hacking Lessons in the process of building this new age company

Nidhi Bisht and Sarjita Jain from India's Leading Women Content Channel will sum up the #SMLive2018 show with a talk on Creating Entertainment for Women with Brands

That's the amazing lineup we have been talking about ever since we launched the initiative this year; as we strive to raise the bar and make this BIGGER & BETTER we are counting on your support to make this happen!

Come and join us to Celebrate #WorldSocialMedia Day

- Show Interest/Attendance to the event here bit.ly/SMLive2018

- Engage with our esteemed speakers who are sparing out time on a Saturday for this cause

- Share your favorite sessions within the network and shower some love using #SMLive2018

[07/07/18, 2:16:17 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Sure :)
[07/07/18, 2:21:49 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Just saw the TEDx video. Glad to see you have started initiative towards a niche and sometime ignored problem.

What I was wondering is that, you are trying to help children' unwind but the real problem is not in the child but with the parents. Maybe in your workshop they will feel good, unwind & stay themselves but when they go back home, they might shrink back.

One of the examples I read recently while reading Psychology.
1. Parents first shout at their kids when they go close to the river or a pond or lake, hence implanting a fear for water.
2. And the same parent they forces the kid to learn swimming in the pool and pay fee for it.

The point is, fear never existed at the first place, their reaction planted it. Let me know if you have any thoughts on the same. Maybe we can talk via PM.

And check out this talk by Sadhguru on a similar topic :)

https://youtu.be/QXqjmIIhIrY
[07/07/18, 2:26:33 PM] Riddhi Doshi (ps): So agree with you Yuvraj....so when i cater to  counseling for the behavioral issues of children, I do not meet the child in the first instance, first two sittings is with the parents , half of the problems are solved then.
[07/07/18, 2:31:17 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Oh nice :) Maybe this will be the topic for your next TED talk. Mindful Parenting for a better future. 

Anyways, wish you all the very best 👍🏽

[08/07/18, 12:32:29 PM] Rushabh (ps): અભ્યાસપૂર્ણ આલેખન:-

Must read....for those who love equity and 
for those who hate equity.....

▪Film actor Rajesh Khanna bought a bungalow in iconic Carter Road in Mumbai for Rs.3.5 lakhs in 1970. His heirs sold it recently for Rs.85 crores. The property has multiplied by 2428 times or an annualized return of 19.38% over 44 years. 

▪Samudhra Mahal in Mumbai is another expensive property. A flat purchased in 1970 at Rs.700 per sq.ft was sold at Rs.1,18,000 per sq.ft in 2013. Money multiplied by 168 times in 43 years. This works out to an annualized return of 12.66% 

▪In 1963, Godrej paid Rs.1 lakh to buy his first house, a 2916 sq.feet apartment at Usha Kiran, Carmicheal road, in tony South Mumbai. In 2011 he sold it for Rs.25 crore. Money multiplied by 2500 times over 48 years or an annualized return of 17.70% 

▪In Dalal Street, Mumbai a sq.feet was Rs.100 in 1980. After 34 years, it sells at Rs.27,000 per sq.ft. Money multiplied by 270 times in 33 years. This works out to an annualized return of 17.90%. 

▪The first three properties can be bought and owned by cream or elite of the society who are worth at least tens of crores, mostly hundreds of crores. 

▪The last property in Dalal street; your father could have bought with whatever money available at his disposal. You can buy it even now. Your son or daughter would be able to buy it even 20 years down the line. 

▪The last property is Sensex. A sq.feet is a metaphor for one unit. If dividend yield is also included (assuming 2% CAGR), Sensex would have delivered 20% annualized returns over last 34 years, higher than the most expensive prime properties in the country. 

Good mutual funds and many stocks have delivered returns far superior to Sensex itself. 

Power of equity is least understood in this country.

If you can withstand notional loss (if you don’t book) in portfolio during bear markets, not worry about daily price movements, it is possible to make much better money than what can be made out of best of real estate. 

Give at least the same importance to equity as you give to real estate. 

You don’t mind holding real estate for 20 or 30 years. Please do the same for equity ignoring bull and bear markets, notional profits and losses. 

Many of you have been investing for last couple of years. Stay the course for at least another 15 to 20 years completely ignoring market fluctuations. You would be amazed at the fortune created for your retirement or to pass on to your children.

[08/07/18, 1:21:49 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): As a real estate professional and an active Investor in equity market, I find absolute zero logic in the above furnished data. 

Let us please be very clear and understand the appreciation of a property, stock or commodity is a based on economic framework of demand and supply. 

It would not be an objective remark to be on either side of the pivot. Let's understand the Intrinsic value of any particular stock, commodity and property and then comment on its virtue of growth.
[08/07/18, 1:24:25 PM] Batman (pushstart): @918779219493 happy birthday dude! Or should I say *PushDay* 😉
[08/07/18, 1:36:22 PM] Swapnil Lahane (ps): Kindly read the message again ...It's crystal clear ...costliest mumbai properties compared with SENSEX....
[08/07/18, 1:43:16 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Exactly my point, Dear friend. What does it mean to compare Apple and a mango and then contrast in an essay ? 

Hypothetical testing could be one way to figure out this kind of an algorithm. Mere significant comparison of two investments with different attributes is vague and subtle.
[08/07/18, 1:45:44 PM] Swapnil Lahane (ps): When we compare fruits vs vegetables ...An apple and a mango comes in the same space ...Anywhich case . The message shows the fact and it cant be denied ...I understand u have a soft corner for Real estate and can't digest the fact that it is in some real pain and will continue to bleed as an investment class...A home to stay is imp ...But RE as Investment .. Specially going forward makes little sense
[08/07/18, 1:56:49 PM] Rushabh (ps): Real estate is a also good investment option. It can generate an ongoing income source. It can also rise in value overtime and prove a good investment in the cash value of the home or land that you buy. You may use it as a part of your overall strategy to begin building wealth. However, you need to be sure that you are ready to begin investing in real estate. Unlike other investments, you will need to spend money to MAINTAIN and CARE for your property in order for it to continue to provide a source of income. Anyways the above msg was simply about giving importance to equity markets same way as we give it to real estate investments. Since i didnt knew the msg which i had posted was against Group rules so would not like to take ahead this discussion & stop it here itself. Thanks
[08/07/18, 1:57:37 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Dear brother, 

No. I disagree to the fact that Real Estate will yield better returns than equity. Had that been I would not have been associated with a VC firm.

1. One asset class that every body loves to hate is equity and RE is something that people are madly passionate about. 

2. I would advise to read you a few books or digest pertaining to Like to Like comparisons and understand better about apples and mangoes. The another book you must find out is The power of Leverage. 

3. Last. Any asset class is brought with an intention to appreciate in terms of its value and not price. It depends on where your poison lies. Thanks ! 

HAPPY SUNDAY !
[08/07/18, 2:09:37 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I'm sorry Rushabh but I didn't knew my comment appeared to be biased when there was no such indication. 

I don't know If my answer helps you but this has been a highly debated topic in most of the Internet forums and people don't vouch for neither RE nor Equity market. Thanks ! Happy Sunday !

[11/07/18, 5:52:18 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Hello everyone,

Can anyone tell me how can I find out the revenue made by service for any phone company? By service I mean the revenue made through repairs at their service centers.

I am guessing the companies might share some report for their annual share holder meeting or disclose it for attracting investment or anything.

#help
[11/07/18, 5:54:25 PM] Awksi (pushstart): You can get them in annual and quarterly reports of the companies. Check out the investor relations tab on the company website
[11/07/18, 6:01:18 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): I did for Samsung, but their revenues aren't shown with respect to each category, like Mobile Sales, Mobile Service, Tablet, Tablet Service etc. I am looking for distinct figures if possible. Any idea?
[11/07/18, 6:08:07 PM] Awksi (pushstart): DMing
[11/07/18, 6:17:19 PM] Amrik (pushstart): If you are looking for info on a Company filing returns in India, You can visit the website of Ministry of Corporate affairs. Register yourself, pay Rs. 100/- online per Company and download the balance sheet.

‎[11/07/18, 6:20:27 PM] Parth Sanghani (ps): ‎image omitted
[11/07/18, 6:22:03 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): I have spent a lot of time on Statistica, but they all talk about the Product line. I am more interested in the service revenue specially for Mobile phones.
[11/07/18, 6:23:12 PM] Parth Sanghani (ps): The graph shows 15% is services so i shared.
[11/07/18, 6:23:50 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): But thank you so much for sharing this :)
[11/07/18, 6:25:50 PM] Parth Sanghani (ps): 👍🏻 Cool
[11/07/18, 6:32:48 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Post it on PushTalent, it's a group on fb by Pushstart for hiring purpose
[11/07/18, 6:35:19 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Companies don't do services....the outsource the same. 

So ideally you should be looking at companies that pickup such contracts. That's 1. Companies may have a service fee./comminsion header. 


The second are local distributor who manage service i.e refurbishing and repairs,i.e parts trading. 

Reliance Brands,ingraam micro the mobile store and the likes would be the companies you should look for.
[11/07/18, 6:39:13 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Particularly for 1 - You mean Apple will allow any other company to repair their iPhones? Plus have access to their parts and components?

I know Maple (authorised dealer of Apple in India) engineers are trained to repair iPhones and Mac but is it true for every company?

What about other brands like Samsung, HTC and Xiaomi?
[11/07/18, 6:42:28 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Yes. Apple may have a single service center where all the major repairs are done. Collections and small cases may be resolved at the local or a mid distrution level. Only serious damage cases go to the main service center which has a TAT of longer wait times, hence a jugad solution.
[11/07/18, 6:43:16 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Plus the companies might not disclose their After Sales Service Partnerships with the companies. Any idea where can I get these?
[11/07/18, 6:50:36 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Usally at their service center locations. And a call at these locations or the forms these locations give.

Or check with there service locations on the website. These are usally "managed" by a partner, usally a territory distributor. Like how car sales and service works.
[11/07/18, 6:53:45 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Hmm alright, will check them out. Thanks for the information. ✌🏼

[17/07/18, 10:53:01 PM] Priyanka Desai (ps): Hustlers, I needed your help in brainstorming:
#1. How much would you pay a PR company to share the funding news in the press?
#2. If you were to work on a retainer model, how much would you pay for 1/2 coverages per month?
Answers, advise much appreciated.
[17/07/18, 10:53:49 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): You need to figure out what are the LEAD and LAG measures for the PR's work

[18/07/18, 12:31:04 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Anyone here who is into reverse logistics or old equipment or someone who can explain me how the exchange offers work...where you give old tech items + some money to get new ones...I want to know what actually happens to the old one, in terms of scarp VALUE of the same.
[18/07/18, 12:34:34 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Cashify does that on a decent scale.
They take the old ones, disintegrate the pieces and sell the respective parts to the companies. At times, they even change few parts in the old phone/laptop and sell it again to the people which is as good as new. 
Rest whatever is unused they sell it on scrap value.
[18/07/18, 2:25:11 PM] Ami Selva Hemani (ps): Tracy Dsouza, who started Girliyapa ( female oriented entertainment / comedy online channel) is doing research on a female entrepreneur / boss’s journey - the idea, how they started , struggles as female , sacrifices, accomplishments, etc. she can be contacted on 9619330360 or Tracy@TheViralFever.com

Any females interested can directly get in touch with her.

Thanks 
Ami
[18/07/18, 2:44:11 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): The idea behind reverse logistics is to maximize, drive every return to it highest and best use. 

It is the money the company can stand to lose by not properly dispositioning it's returned/ excess products. In finance modelling we call it as " COST OF DOING NOTHING ". 

However this concept in Indian ecosystem sounds very vague to me. The reason to it is that It’s all about recovery, nothing about cost of doing it. If somebody will process for 10 rs/unit less but cannot properly execute for a 500rs item, you didn’t save 10rs, you lost 499 rs/unit.
[18/07/18, 2:45:41 PM] Arjun (pushstart): @919960058547 I used to know a company called Greendust that used to do this. Not sure they’re still functioning but 3 years ago they were quite big
[18/07/18, 2:47:50 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): Even @917041388878  was a part of GreenDust
[18/07/18, 2:54:49 PM] Ritu Mittal (ps): Scrap value from my limited experience — 
Electronic goods, machinery etc is completely broken down and stripped out. Each part consists of different metals. They are segregated further. Then sold by weight as per the LME rates. 
So either one refurbishes and sells as second hand or sells as savage scrap to be melted and used for other purpose. 
Knowledge of what lies inside is a key to make good deals. 
Scrap is picked up in lots on kgs basis. Can be a hit and a miss too where estimates go wrong or over exceed and give a windfall.
[18/07/18, 3:00:57 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Interesting question. 

Answer to it : I wouldn't pay you for the advertising but definitely for the PR. Nobody cares how many advertisements you run daily, It's the impressions you make. 

Advertising is like telling people that you are good and hiring a PR is like persuading someone to be convinced that you are the BEST. 

I see a lot of startups which can work only as long as crooks like me don't get in larger volume.

[25/07/18, 4:14:16 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Haha, we have over 20 whatsapp groups, all at max or almost max capacity!
[25/07/18, 4:14:34 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): If we make a telegram to accomodate all, we would need multiple telegram groups as well!
[25/07/18, 4:14:38 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): 😅
[25/07/18, 4:17:11 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Yaha k logo se bore ho gye ho kya? 
@918779219493 she needs more engagement it seems! :)
[25/07/18, 4:17:50 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: lol no...in one telegram group you can have more than 60k people :P
[25/07/18, 4:18:20 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): 5k is the limit for a super group apparantly.. you sure? Bcz thats what google tells me
[25/07/18, 4:19:02 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: i was a part of cryptocurrency group with over 25k people

[25/07/18, 4:23:18 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Spammer
[25/07/18, 4:23:19 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): 🤭
[25/07/18, 4:23:36 PM] Nabomita (pushstart): How many of us use telegram? I downloaded the app and had deleted it to. Found it disturbing
[25/07/18, 4:23:52 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Haha! The best way to get a crowd sourced solution is to give a wrong answer. Everybody jumps to the rescue!
[25/07/18, 4:25:41 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Great question. There were a lot of marketing gimmicks which survived only for an limited time.

However, the features were okayish and not user friendly. This would get much better answers on Quora and very soon at LEHER. 😜
‎[25/07/18, 4:26:38 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): ‎image omitted
[25/07/18, 4:26:53 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: @918277299699 we get it. You are running some app called LEHER. This kind of marketing is not AT ALL scalable. FInd better ways. 🙄🤣
[25/07/18, 4:29:44 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: Since, not many people have left this group already, it is safe to assume this group is delivering some kind of value to the members. Hence, if we shift to a new app/platform, it shouldn't be much of a problem. I have telegram only for cryptocurrency. Nothing else. But as long as it is delivering value, I'll keep it. I think that is the scene with all kinds of apps, isn't it?
[25/07/18, 4:30:52 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): Agreed
[25/07/18, 4:41:28 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Hey Vartika, Hope you been well ! 

Scalability is something I'm not keen at the moment. And well marketing is something that I always get creative or experiment with. 

You must be right, I might end up failing but please make sure I learn something out of it. Also SUGGEST ME SOME BETTER WAYS AND ALSO DEFINITION OF BETTER.  Good day to you !
[25/07/18, 4:43:33 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): True that. The concern with apps is why you use and not what you use ?

Almost all the platforms have similar features. Hence technology stack mein no much evident difference.
[25/07/18, 4:43:35 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: It was a joke. Chill.
[25/07/18, 4:44:16 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I'm in 12 degree Celsius at the moment. Very chilled. How's the climate over there ?

[26/07/18, 4:40:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: #PushUpdate #PushAMA #PushLaunch 
Our first Product Launch+AMA on Pushstart by founder of Wild Earth. 

Ask her anything and everything related to her journey and brand Wild Earth <3 <3 

Shabia Ravi Walia, Founder and Owner of 'Wild Earth' is a media professional for the past 24 years.﻿ 

'Wild Earth' was born out of Shabia's fears of what she put on her baby's body after she became a mother. 

The labels scared her and the fact that she did not understand what went into the products made her uncomfortable. 

Being the solution driven person she is, Shabia started making soaps and lotions in her own kitchen.  

Soon word spread and mothers were demanding her to make the full range. Her experiments proved to be a huge hit with everyone and soon she was forced to move from her kitchen to a proper office and workshop

Today Shabia is proud to have created a brand that provides natural quality products which young, old and babies can use without any fear of side effects of harsh chemicals.

'Wild Earth' today sells online, thru retail stores, is a huge gifting opting for corporates and is exported to quite a few foreign countries, purely on the basis of its quality and the pure intention behind the brand, an intention that was born from a mothers heart and not in a business school.

[27/07/18, 5:14:25 PM] Riddhi Doshi (ps): Udit...we have been trying,couple of times , they have shared the venue with us.
This time , the dates what I am seeing, seems there is no availability of the space.

Also I am looking out for song term partnership as this workshop happens once a month and it's specifically for the women who can't much afford the fees but  surely want to enchance their skills.
So we charge very nominal to them and get trainers on board.
Hence , seeking a free venue ....year long partnership .

‎[06/08/18, 10:58:56 AM] Bhavi Mody (ps): ‎image omitted
[06/08/18, 11:10:34 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Why to charge people for this?
[06/08/18, 11:20:13 AM] Riddhi Doshi (ps): Wow Bhavi
[06/08/18, 11:23:28 AM] Bhavik (pushstart): Have same question
[06/08/18, 11:27:37 AM] Somesh (ps): Agreed. This should be a free initiative for awareness. Not sure if goodies are being given.
[06/08/18, 11:29:23 AM] Ritu Mittal (ps): Guys in my opinion it takes initial investments to put up an initiative like this. So an entry fee would cover that basic cost and also ensure seriousness of the participants. I think it’s fine to charge.
[06/08/18, 11:30:15 AM] Somesh (ps): Currently I am working at TCS as a program manager. Although I worked for 2 years as a product person for one of the clients. We built a new product from scratch as a staffing & onboarding solution for our customers aimed at their HR community. Within 6 months we reached maximum usage of 60K in-house users. Currently I am trying to switch jobs and transition to a completely product role. Happy to be a part of this community.
[06/08/18, 11:30:18 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): +1
[06/08/18, 11:30:43 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Although, to be fair, there are alot of such initiatives which operate for free :)
[06/08/18, 11:33:07 AM] Renuka Ramani: It's never free. Someone is paying for it. It just may not be you .
[06/08/18, 11:49:26 AM] Shabia Walia (ps): Also bhavy gives a t shirt, a goody bag etc, as far as i knw
[06/08/18, 12:00:54 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Includes t shirt, water, refreshments and goody Bag
[06/08/18, 12:04:09 PM] Somesh (ps): Thought so. Then this should be okay I guess.
[06/08/18, 12:07:00 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): It's worth it in that case
[06/08/18, 12:09:01 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): It's sometimes not about just the money.. a lot of participants will come just because they need ROI for the money paid.. in this case, it's way too low.. I know folks who have organised similar events by charging 1000 RS and hundreds of people still turn up..
[06/08/18, 12:15:37 PM] Shabia Walia (ps): Ya money just makes it more valuable to recivers. They are more motivated to turn up if they hve paid for snething.
[06/08/18, 12:28:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What will be the roi for a person paying money in this case?
[06/08/18, 12:28:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Tshirts and refreshments?
[06/08/18, 12:30:49 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Thanks guys for raising the question on why we are charging.
1. It gets us commitment from Participants,which is of utmost importance.
2. There are quite a bit of Logistics involved. We need to cover those costs.
3.  T - shirt, Snacks,Water, and a goody bag ensures you get more than what you are paying.
4. Apart from physical goodies the experience that we create will be the ROI.

I am glad to have had so much of response.
Thanks.

[06/08/18, 6:59:49 PM] Kiran Reddy (ps): Subject- Discover what it takes to receive an early stage investment from an Angel Network

Greetings one and all, 

The good the bad and the ugly. Let's engage to discover what the investor side of the equation looks like. We will explore the theme of investments in the startup ecosystem with Chiranjeev Anand from Lead Angels. 

Lead Angels is India’s first privately owned Angel Network founded by a team of three originally from IIT Bombay in 2014 with the goal of improving early stage investment outcomes. The team accomplishes this by providing professional assistance to Investor-members in company evaluation and the portfolio companies in their operations. 

The 130+ Member Network has grown rapidly to a portfolio of 26 companies in the last three years with a number of stelar successes such as TinMen, SuprDaily and Planet Super Heroes to name a few.

[06/08/18, 8:00:10 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): anyone knows anything about Dropshipping here?
[06/08/18, 8:24:06 PM] Somesh (ps): Hi Nabomita. This was a custom product built on Oracle ADF and SOA technologies. My customers had a gold contract with oracle so we were forced to build it in this. At the core our team has implemented oracle erp for the customers but they didn’t like the iRecruitment module in it so asked us to build custom applications right from the step of job posting to hiring employees. We built this end to end staffing and onboarding solution for them and the onboarding piece reached its max usage of 60K in-house HR community users within 6 months. As a vendor we were able to charge them a huge sum for this but they were more than satisfied with the end result. As for me, I am more of a Staffing & Onboarding cum ERP specialist from my professional experience. We can connect more offline if you want any specific info on this product we built.
[06/08/18, 8:45:50 PM] Ani (pushstart): @Somesh : Is your surname Mhatre?
[06/08/18, 9:00:37 PM] Somesh (ps): Ah no. I am Somesh Sharma

[07/08/18, 12:42:51 PM] Ami Selva Hemani (ps): Some super quick #social media #tips if you are using social media for business purpose:

1. Go through your profile and check all your previous posts and delete the ones which are not in sync with your current profile or might negatively impact your brand/business in any small-big way. (Always remember, people doing business with you tend to check your personal profiles first)

2. Clean it up - Go through your entire friend list and unfriend everyone whom you are no more associated with. This will just clear-up space for more valuable connections to get added. 

3. Always while posting something double check the post for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes or if any unintended negative message is being put up which might hamper your online personality.

4. Never bad mouth anyone, I repeat anyone on social media. Because once it comes back, it will come back very badly. It will do more harm than good.
 
5. Never delete a negative review posted by a client on your posts. Always answer them with kind words and try to tactfully close the issue then and there. Deleting a negative comment might just infuriate the person even more which might trigger them further to take more dire steps.

6. Please avoid all caps in your posts. It is a complete No-No.

7. Please don't randomly tag people on your posts without their permission as this might irritate them and they might even report and block you and you may also be blacklisted by Facebook.

8. Always have your personal profiles maintained well too. This is one of the most important points and should not be ignored.

9. You posts in some or the other way should add value to your readers for them to come back to you for more.

To be continued....

Do you want more? We will be back soon with some more :)
[07/08/18, 12:47:33 PM] Shivani (ps): Amazing tips Ami
[07/08/18, 12:48:14 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Share it on the fb group :)

[07/08/18, 1:07:30 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Super. On point!
[07/08/18, 1:09:34 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Really good insights. 

Regarding deleting irrelevant posts, what about the emotional nostalgia you have with those posts. 
For e.g. as a photographer if I had clicked few decent images and now my photos are better. Shall I remove the older ones from my insta handle or just let it be.

[07/08/18, 2:02:56 PM] Adith Podhar (ps): I started my career in 2005 with ICICI Bank in the International Private Banking products division leading Alternative Investments as an asset class. I helped raise USD 400 mn for two PE funds (ICICI Venture and JM Financial) through ICICI Bank’s network. Post that I founded 'Crepeteria' - a chain of quick serve restaurants. Got seed funded and ran it for 4 years expanding it to 3 cities with multiple format outlets through franchising route. Post Crepeteria exit, I have been on the investments side, first in a boutique investment bank and then joined Motilal Oswal PE Fund (MOPE) on the investments side. At MOPE, have been instrumental in 2 exits for the fund which has given MoCs of 17x (Dixon Technologies - IPO exit) and 7x (Minda Industries - secondary market sale) and have invested USD 15 mn in 2 companies. Was on the board as an observer for 3 portfolio companies. My latest venture is 'Gemba Capital' - which does angel investments. I have been on all the three sides of a transaction - an entrepreneur, banker and an investor.

AMA: All of us have constant questions about the deep (dark?) world of VC funding or investments in general across different levels (Seed to Growth). 

Today, as discussed with Neeraj Joshi, I am doing an AMA to answer any of your queries in and around this topic. 

About me: I have been a global investor and a serial entrepreneur, with multiple successful exits and investments across countries, using my roles as founder of a VC firm while being Advisor to a number of others. 

I take pride in building multi-million dollar companies, Great Manager Institute being the recent one. I run quite a few companies in different geographies. 

I am NOT an expert. I am just a learner and a perennial student.

I am 21 yrs old and currently studying in the 4th year of engineering with experience in website, application, web game development as well as UI/UX. Probably would be applying for master’s next year. I have always been keen about entrepreneurship and business and also planned to start up an e-commerce store for t-shirts with ample of designs. Although, I do not plan on keeping this throughout and have some ideas in mind for the future.  I also had built a small team last year, where we developed websites and applications for clients, but wasn’t perennial. I feel there is so much to learn from you all. It would be great connecting with you all for advices and tips to sustain the market for the present as well as the future.

[09/08/18, 4:07:44 PM] Ritu Mittal (ps): Hey, this is a rather delayed Intro but like they say, der Aaye, Dur-ast Aaye: 


Hello Fellow Crazies who quit the comfort zone of life & dunked into a business! 

I am Ritu Mittal Mukherjee & run *Just Another Show*, a *targeted Consumer Engagement* agency, based in Mumbai but with operations across cities in India. 

If  *Consumers, Meeting your Target Group, Lead Generations, Sales, Brand Awareness, Stake Holder Outreach* are things on your platter, then Yes! We must Connect! If not, even then a Coffee never hurt anyone. 

JAS (Just Another Show) is an Agency specialising in *Targeted Consumer Engagements* Pan- India via *BTL Activations & campaigns*. These campaigns essentially focus on Brand Awareness, Lead Generation, Sales & PR. We hold an *Inventory of over 3 lac School, 2 Lac colleges, 1 lac Apartment Complexes & over 50K Corporate campuses*. We hold inventories for Malls too. JAS enables 2 way communication between the brand & its existing/potential TG via Consumer Behaviour studies & obtaining precious ground feedback. 

Are we the same as a typical Flyer distribution or sampling promotion company? No way! 

JAS partners with you to understand your problem statement, define the TG & narrow down the sample size. Basis the info, a Consumer Engagement Campaign is designed to interact with well defined, pre-disposed TG who are more receptive to your product, services & brand thereby giving you a better ROI. *Qualitative Engagement is the key*  

Do you need to make a choice between Digital, ATL & BTL? - Ermm! calls for another coffee & one can never draw lines! It always depends on your product & the lifecycle stage. but in our experience, BTL is what works on ground eventually & give you conversions be it sales or Apps and not just App downloads but actual installations & usage. 

Looking forward to connect more with this proactive community! 
I welcome Collaborations with complimentary services such as PR, Marketing, Digital & would love to speak to you about what you can do for your product & if & how JAS can help you! 

And we have a story to share: *How JAS did not end up with a website!*

[09/08/18, 10:52:16 PM] Shreya (ps): I am really happy to share with everyone something I've been working on recently - Nishchala. "Nishchala" means "unwavering" in Sanskrit. In Yoga, to have an unwavering focus on one's goal is the steering power of all sadhana. Yogis, a little greedy one could say, to remain unwavering in their endeavour, make use of various tools to aid and enhance awareness. The entire Indian culture, in fact, was basis just this, a tool to human liberation. Now, as time has progressed, and lots of distortion has taken place, many such tools come off as superstitious, and sometimes backward, because the science is lost, and only the story remains. Belief and spirituality do not go hand in hand. With so much distortion, today we see all kinds of yogas, and all kinds of physical exercises happening in the name of yoga. At nishchala, we are creating handwoven 100% natural yoga and meditation mats which are made from materials that are known to aid meditation and spiritual practice. Taking yoga away from the PVC/PER/TPE etc mats, back onto Chattais, on surfaces where the connection with Mother Earth can be experienced in it's profundity, and the purpose of yoga can find full expression.
Please like and share our page, and of course recommend it to yogis who are seeking to return their practice back to nature. 
:) 🙏🕉

[09/08/18, 10:53:48 PM] Shreya (ps): Good evening, I am Shreya, founder of Nishchala. We create handwoven traditional yoga mats which are 100% natural and biodegradable. You can read a little about it in the above write up.
[09/08/18, 10:54:27 PM] Shreya (ps): We have just launched, and are looking for advice on marketing from someone who is focused on sustainable products.

What I do: I define your brand communication plan and ensure that you your content and social teams have their activity roadmap planned.

Social media: From listing social tools and defining your strategy for each channel to drafting basic social communication guidelines, defining hashtags and more, I'll tidy your social operations and match it to your brand goals.

What more? I also train your team to understand and execute these content and social plans.

If you are looking for a quick turnaround time (1.5-2 weeks) to set your communication strategy, let's connect here or via DM to discuss this :)

[15/08/18, 10:53:41 AM] ‪+91 97699 30880‬: Just adding on: this is not just a strategy + training. There are lots of takeaways! I'll also be sharing templates that you could use, list of tools that can help your unique case, a brief competition analysis and how you can maintain an edge over the rest, etc. It is a comprehensive communication plan and it is ready-to-execute :)

[15/08/18, 11:20:43 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): So you mean to help or sell your services
[15/08/18, 11:21:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Selling looks on the face. The definition of help is changing 🔥🔥
[15/08/18, 11:29:15 AM] ‪+91 97699 30880‬: I need two clients who I can help with defining their communication atrategy
[15/08/18, 11:30:02 AM] Neeraj Joshi: How much will u charge?
[15/08/18, 11:30:35 AM] Neeraj Joshi: We use the word help usually when things are pro bono
[15/08/18, 11:31:30 AM] ‪+91 97699 30880‬: Thank you for pointing that out. This is not pro-bono, unfortunately. About the charges, I can share once I know your requirement.
[15/08/18, 11:31:55 AM] ‪+91 97699 30880‬: I am a freelance content strategist :)
[15/08/18, 11:33:42 AM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Do you just strategise or execute as well, can you help as a freelancer managing drafting of content blog.. social & everything else on your own for a client of ours who is foraying into b2b (auto-spares) domain or is it that you just plan minus the execution.
[15/08/18, 11:33:50 AM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): Happy to help folks on a call for anything that relates to Social Media Strategy 🙂
[15/08/18, 11:33:56 AM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): *Pro Bono*
[15/08/18, 11:34:29 AM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): I come from an entirely different background so probably my question can be knaive but intent noble. 😊
[15/08/18, 11:34:52 AM] ‪+91 97699 30880‬: Unfortunately, at the moment I am only working on strategy projects. However, I can connect you to people who can help with execution. Let me know if you'd like that. I can drop an email to connect you with an excellent social media manager
[15/08/18, 11:35:51 AM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Oops.. means you can't help here.. anyways will pm you post speaking to client
[15/08/18, 11:37:37 AM] ‪+91 97699 30880‬: I won't be able to help, but can direct you to people who can :) so, in case you'd like that, I'd be glad to connect!
[15/08/18, 11:57:03 AM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: How are you going to strategise a company’s complete social media over a call? That isn’t even possible. Being in the industry for 4 years, it’s just weird when people say such things.

For a good Social media strategy you need a deep understanding of the business first, and then it’s an on going process of trials and errors and iterations.
[15/08/18, 12:01:21 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): Have seen through Strategy for multiple brands across Industries over the past 8 years
[15/08/18, 12:01:46 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): I m not saying a call here*
[15/08/18, 12:02:00 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): Just a call* I meant
[15/08/18, 12:02:12 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: For companies whose target audience, traction and transaction is heavily dependent on social media, a good, high quality strategy is more important than just random execution. My intent here is to just educate in general. A lot of companies sometimes are not even aware they need one until it’s too late.
[15/08/18, 12:03:37 PM] Dikshant (ps): Hello Everyone,
Is there anyone who can help me on IOT Project.
[15/08/18, 12:03:55 PM] ‪+91 91677 39375‬: Yess of course
[15/08/18, 12:04:16 PM] ‪+91 91677 39375‬: We are specialist in this area
[15/08/18, 12:04:28 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: Really? My bad then. When you said Pro bono it just looked like you were someone starting out in the industry. That is the general trend. 😂
[15/08/18, 12:04:32 PM] Dikshant (ps): Dm
[15/08/18, 12:04:50 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): That's precisely what we do at Social Samosa educate folks on optimizing the use of Social Media for their business.
[15/08/18, 12:08:55 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Sir Aapka level he kuch aur hai. DMing you for some guidance
[15/08/18, 12:09:44 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): I understand that Start Up Founders might not have budgets to afford a high value resource for Social Media Strategy. 

What they need is a good roadmap to follow and execution can be managed with a junior resource as well.

I have seen Pushstart grow over the past 8-10 Months and I personally don't want them to burn fingers with Social Media Agencies/Consultants the least I can do is guide them over a call or multiple calls
[15/08/18, 12:18:17 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): And even if I was someone starting that is a quick judgment to pass :)
[15/08/18, 12:19:50 PM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): starting afresh*

[15/08/18, 6:55:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi All! Posting on behalf of The Goa Project (TGP).

The Goa Project is an annual “unconference” that brings together a diverse set of people from various fields – to converse, collaborate and co-create. The entire agenda is crowdsourced, leading to two exciting days of talks, workshops, presentations, pitches and interventions. Run completely by volunteers who are passionate about cross-sector learning, collaboration and ideas.

The sixth edition of TGP will happen on the 26-27th of Oct at a secret location that's NOT Goa! Yes you heard that right. We're also launching a week long (19-25th Oct, 2018) fully-funded TGP Residency where business owners, makers, thinkers, do-ers will be matched with inter-disciplinary collaborators bringing in an opportunity for both venture owners & collaborators to work on innovative solutions! 

This is where you come in! TGP is looking to reach out to exceptional venture-owners who will bring interesting flavors to the residency (they're also looking to find equally interesting collaborators, but more on that on a later date) and for this, included below are the application and more information links. We urge you to apply right away (deadline is 18th Aug), if you know someone who could benefit from this too, do spread the word to them as well!

Application link:  https://goo.gl/forms/ebqciZ1NTJf3oasZ2
More details on the residency: http://www.thegoaproject.com/eligibility-criteria/ 
FAQs: http://www.thegoaproject.com/faqs/ 

If you think you'd make an awesome volunteer instead, apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/ZpBmUvsQYv4IGQ8F2

[16/08/18, 9:01:43 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): Anyone who is into client acquisition, would agree that it really is a tough nut to crack. Most of us don't even like pitching because it is so unpredictable while being one of the most vital aspects of any business.

What if I tell you that most of the people do suck at pitching because of one, very simple evolutionary phenomenon?

What if I tell you that there is still a way in which you can overcome this. Well, it's all in the MIND!🧠🧠🧠

You will be fascinated by unraveling how different things are  from what we ASSUME.

Read on to dive deeper into understanding how the evolution has made pitching so complex and how we do have a way to use Psychology for turning the tables into our favour.

So if you consider yourself to be nothing like the norm, do swing by to see what we have in store for you and rub shoulders with other radical innovators like yourself and get quality feedback on your startup. Fret not if your startup is not there yet, you can come to watch what others have been up to and lend some feedback of your own! It's always a win-win out here!

When: 24th August'18, 4 pm onwards
Where: 91springboard, Lotus Star, Andheri

Register here: https://bit.ly/2M8oBU9

[22/08/18, 6:40:16 PM] Shreya (ps): Hello! I am Shreya! I have recently launched a venture making natural yoga mats. All the mats are handwoven by rural artisans in Tamil Nadu. Many of these weavers had given up weaving after power looms became popular. Now we have gone and collected 15 of them and given them this opportunity of making the mats and soon we’ll form a society to ensure job security for them. Really grateful to connect with Shraddha through this group. She’s helping me market the products in the right manner :)
[22/08/18, 6:41:27 PM] Riddhi Doshi (ps): Hey Shreya.....

[22/08/18, 9:46:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi Pushstart people,
I am thinking to organize an informal workshop wherein we discuss the opportunities & challenges in paid media marketing for startups & small & medium companies.
 Some of the Questions which will be covered:
- Which channel is the apt channel to advertise?
- At what stage should we do paid ads?
- what objectives to choose per channel to get maximum results
- how do we get ROI on our spends, Etc.
I will organize this informal event if I have interest from 10-15 people. 15 people max so that we can understand everyone's business problem clearly. Do say 'Aye' if you are interested & will decide the place & time. 

Thanks,
Saajan Jain

[24/08/18, 5:48:25 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): It seems fun to raise debts but painful to retire them..

And If you borrow an opinion from a person who has raised in debt, there a very few chances of repaying investors. 😜
[24/08/18, 5:50:02 PM] Shabia Walia (ps): 😊😊let me put it another way Giridhar. We have got an offer, so I wanted to evaluate pros and cos of both. I am happy to even talk to smeone who understands it rather than have raised it.

[24/08/18, 5:53:12 PM] Ayush Goyal (ps): i took loan from local vendors  (but for service marketplace, not product), let me know if can be of any help.
[24/08/18, 5:55:14 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Interesting. I can guide you to a certain extent. 

Debt raise is actually fun unless it reaches the ceiling post which the consequences are immediate and dramatic. 

Also depends on the cheque size and other parameters of the fund raise.

‎[25/08/18, 12:19:18 PM] Abhijit Anita Ref (ps): ‎Contact card omitted
[25/08/18, 12:20:14 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We have created a new group “Mumbai pushstarters 03”. Do recommend your friends to become part of it. 

Kindly share the contacts here so that we can add them to the new group ❤️❤️
[25/08/18, 12:20:33 PM] Abhijit Anita Ref (ps): Please include Akshay
[25/08/18, 12:20:41 PM] Abhijit Anita Ref (ps): Have informed him

[25/08/18, 12:23:17 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Neeraj..one small suggestion if you can implement it .

Do create group either with Mumbai pin code or by area wise like Andheri ..like *Mumbai -Pushstarter Andheri*

This will gives clear pic on the members .

What says people
[25/08/18, 12:24:03 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Where's the diversity?
[25/08/18, 12:24:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Also if anyone of the pushstarters from this group wants to join “Mumbai pushstarters 03” follow the link below:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/31D5FClwk4K14ej3pBxyxd
[25/08/18, 12:25:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes planning something on similar lines.
[25/08/18, 12:25:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Both pros and cons for it but :(
[25/08/18, 12:26:17 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): A suggestion on this front - since WhatsApp has limitation on number of people in a group then why not start with telegram. It's amazing and fun to use. No limitations on number of people in a group. 
Just a thought.
[25/08/18, 12:27:10 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): +1
[25/08/18, 12:28:46 PM] Abhijit Anita Ref (ps): Whats app for business...does it have limit as well?
[25/08/18, 12:29:58 PM] Vinayak deshpande (pushstart): I doubt if we can create groups using whatsapp business
[25/08/18, 12:30:52 PM] ‎Samant (pushstart) joined using this group's invite link
[25/08/18, 12:38:58 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Agree shashank..
But since many people are using whatapp since years ...don't know how many will shift to telegram.
[25/08/18, 12:39:07 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Slack is great
[25/08/18, 12:39:35 PM] Bharat Acharya (pushstart): They will adjust
[25/08/18, 12:39:55 PM] Bharat Acharya (pushstart): It is a neccessity or we will not be able to have full efficiency
[25/08/18, 12:40:02 PM] Bharat Acharya (pushstart): Personal opinion
[25/08/18, 12:40:04 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): It is a big task also in whatapp wherein admin has to keep tracking the activities of different group .
[25/08/18, 12:40:29 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: People are missing put on help they could get from other group members connections.

[25/08/18, 12:43:06 PM] Aniruddha Kalbade (ps): Thanks
[25/08/18, 12:44:32 PM] Dimple (ps): I suggest make an excel sheet with name Nmbr website and one line intro
[25/08/18, 12:45:07 PM] Dimple (ps): Share with every push start member so it can be put to proper use as well
[25/08/18, 12:45:37 PM] Dimple (ps): At least ppl can connect privately too without disturbing other 255ppl in the grp
[25/08/18, 12:46:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Cannot share the database with everyone @919998809466 :)
[25/08/18, 12:46:12 PM] Dimple (ps): Not everyone
[25/08/18, 12:46:18 PM] Dimple (ps): Only push start member
[25/08/18, 12:46:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We are coming up with the product. Will solve most of the problems
[25/08/18, 12:46:21 PM] Dimple (ps): Members
[25/08/18, 12:46:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: just stay tuned
[25/08/18, 12:46:34 PM] Dimple (ps): Why everyone shd get this privilege
[25/08/18, 12:46:43 PM] Dimple (ps): Cool
[25/08/18, 12:46:46 PM] Dimple (ps): Sounds good
[25/08/18, 12:46:56 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Unless there is a dynamic(automated) way of updating the sheet, it would be one heck of a job to maintaining and updating it.
[25/08/18, 12:46:57 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Agree with neeraj...we can't share such info on open platform
[25/08/18, 12:47:42 PM] Dimple (ps): No no not open platform only push start members.. Active members
[25/08/18, 12:47:54 PM] Sakshi Rastogi (91): Has worked well for us so far. Initial hesitation but I think it was easier cause we are in position to reaffirm since we bump into a members physically. Online communities could be more tricky  in the beginning. :)
[25/08/18, 12:48:04 PM] Dimple (ps): The less quality members who can actually get in touch with each other
[25/08/18, 12:48:41 PM] Dimple (ps): Less but quality I mean!!!
[25/08/18, 12:51:12 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Agreed. Plus telegram offers you much more features and utilities.
If you want to create an event, you can do it their itself and automate the whole thing. 
Any Telegram expert here?
[25/08/18, 12:52:10 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Telegram expert? You mean active userm
[25/08/18, 12:52:31 PM] ‪+91 96199 66319‬: Sounds like the best suggestion
[25/08/18, 12:54:06 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Yes. Moreover who would know how to create bots and automate jobs like event creation. 
Simple use case - a new user can join the telegram and introduce himself/herself. Simultaneously, Mr. Bot can store his/her information in the Push-start database. 
You can target the whole database in one click.
[25/08/18, 12:56:36 PM] Dimple (ps): I personally would not like to add myself to many apps to connect with ppl I can connect here . . I could use that time somewhere else
[25/08/18, 12:58:44 PM] Sakshi Rastogi (91): Didn't know about this feature. Taking this on DM with you. This is super helpful
[25/08/18, 1:04:08 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): People ...

Can we have one session either live in whatapp group or Facebook group of pushstarter Where in One person who know how to handle telegram can take this session as *Introduction to Telegram and how to operate it*

Final decision rest with Admin 

Neeraj bhai..what says ...
[25/08/18, 1:05:34 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): I think @918953881643 would know about this detail.
PS - Anyone who has closely followed cryptocurrency definitely must be knowing about Telegram.
[25/08/18, 1:06:11 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: It's not very different or difficult 😅 everyone can get used to it after 2-3 days. Just one post about basic usage would do.
[25/08/18, 1:07:23 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Yeah lot like any other chat app
[25/08/18, 1:07:33 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Shashank..cryptocurrency se I remember one guy ...rishi gangoli...Good mentor for taking session in this topic
[25/08/18, 1:07:41 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Just follow Google.. its simple to do unless you are trying to make a bot
[25/08/18, 1:08:39 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Ohh,, how nice!
Would get in touch with him. 
Is he on this group?
[25/08/18, 1:09:33 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Group me nai hai
[25/08/18, 1:09:34 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): He is on telegram
[25/08/18, 1:09:38 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Yes, we can get started with the basic stuff. Anyone bot and automation would primarily be Admin's job. @918779219493 🤤😉😉
[25/08/18, 1:10:47 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Are pagal ho jayega..Humara Pyara Admin...itne sare ...pushstarters group whatapp pe ban jayege to...
[25/08/18, 1:11:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Guys can we have this discussion on the fb group?
[25/08/18, 1:11:03 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Bot creation is easy. Even bot can be added to telegram group. Only stuff I have to check is can we read telegram for e.g how can bot know new member has joined etc. But it is useful thing to do. Tagging @918779219493
[25/08/18, 1:11:15 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Let others also participate ❤
[25/08/18, 1:11:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Soneone create a post and share the link here :)
[25/08/18, 1:11:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *someone
[25/08/18, 1:12:43 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Every invite link will take you to a bot profile where you submit your details. Once you have submitted your details, bots lets you access the main group which you can join. 
I think it's highly customizable. 
what do you say @918953881643 ?
[25/08/18, 1:13:57 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yes. Indeed its super complicated at times due to its features
[25/08/18, 1:14:49 PM] Renuka Ramani: Folks - we are giving away a clear glass board excellent quality 6X4 from our office,  please ping me for details. Admin - Many apologies if the post is not according to guidelines 🙏🏽... Please ping me if you can take it between today and tomorrow

*just saying*
[25/08/18, 6:14:03 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Got a a call from Mumbai Commissioner office

[25/08/18, 6:14:22 PM] ‪+91 96199 66319‬: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
[25/08/18, 6:17:02 PM] ‪+91 96199 66319‬: Also, while mentioning or not mentioning religion is debatable.... There's no guarantee they were Muslims. Could have been Salman fans for all there is 😅

[25/08/18, 6:17:11 PM] ‪+91 96199 66319‬: Jk
[25/08/18, 6:18:17 PM] ‪+91 96199 66319‬: These details should rather be disclosed to the police, rather than on a public platform. Mentioning the religion is also equally fine, so I won't crib...
[25/08/18, 6:18:30 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): And yes for people getting hurt with my  mention about Muslim in description.

Small clarification-

I was reporting an incident which  happened with me where I was hit and it was a situation if chaos.

2nd describing accused needs all kinds of details and here Muslim was written as just a detail (they had the typical Muslim beard as a feature which i had also narrated on call)

My cabbie was also a Muslim and so I don't think I need to give explanation about my unbiased Views about any religion. (It was his original statement- that this kind of hooliganism is possible by Muslims of these kinds)

I am against those people who promote this hooliganism as the accused mentioned about their dominance in the area.
[25/08/18, 6:20:26 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Take care & Get well soon brother. Country needs you & needs you sound. 😊

[30/08/18, 12:06:00 PM] ‪+91 98902 62176‬: Hello sir.
I have an idea that can bring revolution in  *CONSTRUCTION*  INDUSTRY in India. There is a new technology from ITALY which can be very beneficial to *BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS*  in construction .
When the load acting on the slab is large or clear span between columns is more, the slab thickness is on increasing. It leads to consume more material such as concrete and steel, due to that self-weight of slab is increase.
So this technology have a great solution for this.
 As per our research we save Rs 1750/ m3 of concrete slab   than normal one and the amount of steel and concrete is reduced upto large extent .
[30/08/18, 12:06:57 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Does this have a market in india? Do we have huge clear span between columns?
[30/08/18, 12:07:18 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Wont that tech be patented?
[30/08/18, 12:07:28 PM] ‪+91 98902 62176‬: Its already patented
[30/08/18, 12:07:48 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): So how would u use it? Except when its ur own patent..
[30/08/18, 12:09:02 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Elaundry
[30/08/18, 12:09:22 PM] ‪+91 98902 62176‬: we can do tie up with company

Its a closed door event limited to 15 people only as we need everyone to be interactive so that we can address individual problems when it comes to paid media channels & campaigns.

[03/09/18, 10:34:22 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Good morning Pushstarters. This is Akshay Kenkre. From today we are starting a specialised vertical for start-ups. Finance as an area is often the most critical piece of business and start ups often lack support in this area. We intend to fill the gap by handholding various start ups by mentoring, advising, working towards effective taxes and compliance. This would help you to clear due diligences and would enable a start up to be structured while seeking funds. We also have a strong M&A arm, which could help you navigate through your M&A times. We are not a PE or a fund but a trabsaction enabler. Investors do not look only at the idea, but also the viability of the execution of idea in a structured form. In case you have any questions, shoot an email to akshaykenkre@transprice.in or ping me on my number. Have a great week ahead.

[10/09/18, 8:58:15 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): They are right. Otherwise mortgage loan is one option

[11/09/18, 12:14:38 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Hi all, 

Need a help, please.

I am looking for an Indian e-commerce portal (preferably a startup or run by aspiring entrepreneurs) to sell my books in India. 

Any guidance/support will be much appreciated! 

Thank you.

Kind regards,
Nithya Prabu.
[11/09/18, 12:15:29 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Hi Nithya, have you looked into Shopify?
[11/09/18, 12:16:58 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): It is an ecommerce tool for Facebook right? I don’t want to set up one Udit. I want someone to take care of listing the books, collecting orders/money and delivering it to the customers.
[11/09/18, 12:17:37 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): I just want to write, publish and market 😊
[11/09/18, 12:17:37 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Aah..got you. In that case, your best option is Amazon.
[11/09/18, 12:17:45 AM] ‪+91 98195 63920‬: Amazon KDP
[11/09/18, 12:17:47 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Most people buy books from Amazon
[11/09/18, 12:18:03 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Amazon India wouldn’t let me self publish hard copies.
[11/09/18, 12:18:19 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): KDP allows me to sell Kindle versions
[11/09/18, 12:18:21 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Don't even look for anything else, I will be very honest with you. Just hand over all your books to Amazon and let them handle the delivery
[11/09/18, 12:18:24 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Which I’m doing already
[11/09/18, 12:18:49 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): It’s not available in India, Udit hence the trouble.
[11/09/18, 12:19:26 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): have you tried Flipkart?
[11/09/18, 12:20:05 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): They want a mainstream publisher
[11/09/18, 12:20:49 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): The other option is really to setup your own store, and then tie up with a delivery company like delhivery and let them handle the shipping.
[11/09/18, 12:20:52 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Are you self publishing?
[11/09/18, 12:20:59 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Hire a intern
[11/09/18, 12:21:02 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Yes Vaibhav
[11/09/18, 12:21:35 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Hmm sounds interesting
[11/09/18, 12:22:24 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Setting up a store on Shopify will take you like a day's time considering you only have one book. You will need a RazorPay Account which you can connect to your Shopify to connect payment
[11/09/18, 12:23:13 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): On every purchase you will get notification, the following day, ask the intern to hand over the books to Delhivery while you can continue focusing on writing, publishing and marketing
[11/09/18, 12:23:31 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): You will also be able to build your own brand name if you are setting up your own store
[11/09/18, 12:23:47 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Udit, I’ve 4 books and I live in the U.K. I find it difficult to set up even a paytm account. Hence.
[11/09/18, 12:23:53 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): collect payment* (Sorry for the typo)
[11/09/18, 12:24:20 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Are you completely based out of UK?
[11/09/18, 12:24:32 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): But your suggestions are definitely interesting will check the options at my end
[11/09/18, 12:24:49 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Yes and I travel to India for business/personal reasons
[11/09/18, 12:25:06 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): I can help you with setting up shop here
[11/09/18, 12:25:14 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): If your parents are based out of India then you can setup a small LLC under their name
[11/09/18, 12:25:41 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): But trust me, this will help you build a better brand and you will be in 1000% control over every process which is crucial.
[11/09/18, 12:25:48 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): LLP*

[11/09/18, 12:27:57 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Thank you very much, Udit.
[11/09/18, 12:29:07 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon
[11/09/18, 12:29:13 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Rest are of no use
[11/09/18, 12:29:25 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Ask your publisher to get it done
[11/09/18, 12:29:35 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): They usually take care of it
[11/09/18, 12:29:39 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): No problem :)
[11/09/18, 12:30:25 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Thank you Vaibav.
[11/09/18, 12:30:53 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): No Problem Nithya
[11/09/18, 12:31:53 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Nithya, what niche are your books into if you don't mind me asking?
[11/09/18, 12:32:54 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Study Abroad (1 published, 1 ready to go), Motivational Poetry (1 published, 1 ready to go), Children's Illustration (1), Another poetry on its way,
[11/09/18, 12:33:17 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): For Children's you should connect with Richa from GetLitt
[11/09/18, 12:33:39 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): https://www.amazon.in/Nithya-Prabu/e/B072XYFWGJ/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1536606203&sr=8-1 - that's my Amazon page.
[11/09/18, 12:33:43 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): She has a children's e-learning platform and is connecting with more publishers, she might have more connections for you
[11/09/18, 12:33:53 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Sure thing Udit; we met and I am yet to send her a copy of my book :)
[11/09/18, 12:34:10 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Aah okay :)
[11/09/18, 12:35:24 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Another person who might be able to help you will be Gautam from ClassDoor
[11/09/18, 12:35:38 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): He is a fellow PushStarter as well
[11/09/18, 12:36:18 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Sure thing; Udit, will do!
[11/09/18, 12:37:57 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): On a different note, we have influencers for clothes, beauty, travel, tech products just about everything but why not books? We don't we have book influencers?
[11/09/18, 12:38:46 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): What do you mean by book influencers Aditya? Please can you elaborate?
[11/09/18, 12:38:53 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): *why
[11/09/18, 12:41:04 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): So let's say there are certain people who do beauty products review or travel hotel interview on Instagram and their audience looks forward to these reviews and buy the products they endorse. And these are 'ordinary' people. So hypothetically a book influencer will say review ka book once a week and people who follow him/her will respect that view.
[11/09/18, 12:41:49 AM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Ohh ok.. i get it.. i think there are a few in India - can't remember their names though!
[11/09/18, 12:42:12 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): There are, contact Pradeep Kumar from BookWritten. he has a community of 6k avid readers :)
[11/09/18, 12:42:28 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Not sure if I am allowed to post the link here
[11/09/18, 12:42:29 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): There are general influencers whose advise we take like Sapiens went crazy popular after a lot of famous people endorsed it. But there are 1000s of travel influencers whose job is to do just that and they earn quite a lot.
[11/09/18, 12:42:42 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Ahh OK!
[11/09/18, 12:42:49 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): but just head to Facebook and search for BookWritten @Aditya Khanduri
[11/09/18, 12:42:52 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I wasn't sure, so was wondering!
[11/09/18, 12:43:17 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Will do
[11/09/18, 12:43:20 AM] Udit Goenka (ps): Haha, Pradeep is an amazing person. He will gladly help
[11/09/18, 12:46:29 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): But to continue this line if thought, I also think books are a rare buy, in the sense people buy clothes and other items much more frequently so maybe this plays a part 🤔
[11/09/18, 12:48:44 AM] Pravash Dey (ps): There are various book clubs like Ahmedabad Book Club, Gujarati Book Club, etc can definitely help
[11/09/18, 12:49:13 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Hmm
[11/09/18, 4:42:43 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): When you work with an influencer, you have to let go and allow him to narrate the way he/ she wants. At the end of the day Its the stories that sell and not the product.

Amidst the human data revolution, the idealogy or thought process in the books cannot be (well-left) by influencers and thus results in ambiguity moreover the accuracy of post is difficult to measure.

[13/09/18, 11:04:41 AM] Lakhan (Womaniya): Me & my friend Siddharth were intrigued after seeing our family groups bursting with content, so we decided to go to our hometowns and meet many such people, on what they use and what are their daily routines.

After we met all demographics - men, women, youth, we found out that men & youth are already using their phones to work and are satisfied with all apps/services, but women can do much more in the free time they have in the day, from their the idea was born and we started testing it.
[13/09/18, 11:06:16 AM] Lakhan (Womaniya): After testing for 2 months with a community of 5000 women through WhatsApp broadcast, we launched the app.
[13/09/18, 11:07:01 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): 👍🏻👍🏻

[13/09/18, 11:38:19 AM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): Job Opening for Kalaage's social media marketing team. Someone with prior email marketing experience is preferred.

Requirements:
# Candidate must know how important it is to take customer feedback.
# Candidate must know the difference between sending out your message and spamming someone.
# Candidate must know that there should always be an option to opt-out of the email marketing list if the receiver doesn't want to get spammed.

Please let Kalaage know of any reference. 
They need an email marketing guy urgently-
SO THEY WOULD STOP SPAMMING MY EMAIL INBOX.

Context- I have already replied to their emails 3 times stating that I want an exit from their email marketing list. But they don't seem to have any 'reply' option within their company.

Best wishes to Kalaage's Marketing team.
[13/09/18, 11:40:57 AM] Lakhan (Womaniya): Initially there were organic, then we did some paid marketing also, and now we have launched a leaderboard based referral program.

[13/09/18, 12:01:56 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: That’s awesome. I had seen the app but there was no place to create content.
[13/09/18, 12:02:47 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: Once that happens, the traction will increae phenomenally.
[13/09/18, 12:02:52 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: Increase*

[15/09/18, 3:19:52 PM] ‪+91 81081 04481‬: Hello friends, request for help. I am looking for some feedback please on a new business that is being launched.

Do you think whether a shirt subscription service will work in India or not? Don't buy shirts... Instead Subscribe and every month get a new shirt. At end of subscription, shirts are returned.

Can you please share your views on this concept? Thank you 🙏 

Note: as I'm not on FB, Neeraj has kindly made an exception and allowed this msg here. Thanks Neeraj
[15/09/18, 3:20:47 PM] Lakhan (Womaniya): Yeah if I am getting new shirts every month in decent price
[15/09/18, 3:21:15 PM] Neeraj Joshi: There was a startup I saw doing the same thing long time back. Did u check it out?
[15/09/18, 3:21:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I forgot the name
[15/09/18, 3:21:24 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): There were few companies which has already done this
[15/09/18, 3:21:32 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): This is not a good way to gather feedback, everything will get segmented. Instead you can make a Google Form and put in the question, ask for out age, location, some other optional info and gather it all at one place.
[15/09/18, 3:21:34 PM] Neeraj Joshi: They also came for some competition
[15/09/18, 3:21:35 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): Dint work well
[15/09/18, 3:23:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I don't really buy new clothes every month. And I guess every early-stage founder would agree with me. This might work for people working in corporates where it is a compulsion to look good and wear formal clothing
[15/09/18, 3:25:56 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I think it was this: http://www.ohlook.in/
[15/09/18, 3:28:02 PM] Vaibhav Adsul (pushstart): Ohlook was in this space
[15/09/18, 3:42:24 PM] Ayush Goyal (ps): Does that means I will be receiving used but washed shirts every month?
[15/09/18, 3:45:07 PM] ‪+91 81081 04481‬: Brand new shirt every month
[15/09/18, 3:48:29 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I think as long as you can promise the shirts will be as good as new, maybe people will try.

However shirt isn't a very expensive exclusive wear imo. So people usually have quite a few. This can work for expensive luxurious designer products though.
[15/09/18, 3:48:41 PM] ‪+91 81081 04481‬: 👍

[15/09/18, 3:51:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Why would I subscribe when I can buy a shirt at a click of a button anytime I want?
[15/09/18, 3:53:20 PM] Neeraj Joshi: You subscribe to a service for a month when u can take benefit out of it for a month. You will have to make yearly plans for this
[15/09/18, 3:53:45 PM] Sahil Minimalist (ps): Saw the same thing but for socks and that got funded via Shark tank a few years back. But I think ideas like these are more suited for evolved markets like US
[15/09/18, 3:54:05 PM] Gaurav Naini (ps): Why the Shirt Return aspect after a year?
[15/09/18, 3:56:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What will happen to the shirts once they are returned? In line with @919730697738’s question
[15/09/18, 3:58:21 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): I shop for all my shirts for my husband, and i am quite picky with the fit and he is worse than me. How will a shirt come every month that will fit our aesthetics pls? Fit is far off, do people get to select the fabric or colours. I used to Subscribe to a cosmetic bag subscription called fab bag that allowed me to choose at least 1 product of 4-5 in the bag every month. Just shared thoughts that immediately sprung up for me.
[15/09/18, 4:06:51 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I'm not really great at advices but might want to take you a round across some reality check. 

1. Market at the moment is very naive and nascent to understand your concept. India would take time to evolve. 

2. Idea is fantastic. But this is an operational business and has ops inefficiencies. Although a few who denied now would be your early adapters 😜

3. In line with one of the comments, how do you manage the aesthetic fit and fabric choice ? The person who would want 10 shirts every month would be very particular about what he wears. 

P.S - If you get through these questions, please shoot in your deck to me.

Hi Fellas, we are soon going to launch an e-commerce store for KrishVeda.com (not live yet)
Pls share your recommendation on which is the best platform for launching a SaaS based e-commerce store for selling to Indian as well as International markets...
[16/09/18, 4:32:41 PM] Vineet (pushstart): Hey Anurag, Wucommerce and shopify are good but have scalability concern... Get a customized one built.. We at MTW Labs can help you out with one....
[16/09/18, 4:43:07 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Launching as in like #pushlaunch?
[16/09/18, 4:44:30 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Yes. Next month... #PushLaunch toh karenge hi 😉
[16/09/18, 4:44:38 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): Shopify has everything one needs to scale. I know people doing over $4-5m in sales per month on Shopify with super ease! :) 

Customize solution is never a good idea for ecom because of so many reasons.
[16/09/18, 4:44:52 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Ok, thanks, will ping you separately...
[16/09/18, 4:45:21 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): Anurag, go with Shopify with your eyes closed! :)
[16/09/18, 4:45:41 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): It will not only save you money, but it will help you scale a lot faster with all the required tools that you need to scale up instantly.
[16/09/18, 4:46:07 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): You can get your Shopify store up and running in less than 5 business working days depending on the number of products you have.
[16/09/18, 4:46:33 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): I have got decent feedback for shopify but just want to see which are the other alternatives available in market before I close in on one...
[16/09/18, 4:46:49 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Thanks Udit
[16/09/18, 4:47:20 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): I am working with 9 ecom clients at the moment, some were on custom build and always had to deal with issues with regards to SEO, security and much more.
[16/09/18, 4:47:46 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): Now all of them are on Shopify and they don't have to burn any money on custom development because ecom is already very thin margin business.
[16/09/18, 4:48:24 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): Shopify offers everything from security to scalability. More than that, you won't be dependent on anyone which is a HUGE plus.
[16/09/18, 4:49:24 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Great
[16/09/18, 4:49:45 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Thanks for your detailed feedback

[16/09/18, 4:50:14 PM] Vineet (pushstart): Test your idea with Shopify... Once it is reaching Plateau.. You will figure it out when to get a new one built... Ping me if you have concern.. We can speak...
[16/09/18, 4:51:19 PM] Udit Goenka (ps): lol Neeraj, you know me. I always try to help as many people out as possible. Specially startup because I have seen many of them burning their capital initially.

[17/09/18, 2:55:59 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Never mind but just wanted to ask one thing.. does it sound ethical to share personal info this way without asking them.

@918779219493  or anyone else who would like to share their opinion
[17/09/18, 2:56:20 PM] Harshal (uberpass): Shall I give your reference?
[17/09/18, 2:58:14 PM] Abodid (pushstart): No. They might not recognise straight away..  I do have a lot of connects over the creative space through many second degree connects.. esp when I curated them for a creative confluence I was heading in our college.

Just give a try from your side without any reference. 😅
[17/09/18, 2:58:42 PM] Harshal (uberpass): Oh OK
[17/09/18, 2:58:45 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): Exactly my thoughts. As much as one wants to help, it’s not the best practise to just share off someone’s contact without permit or at least knowing the purpose it’s required for.
[17/09/18, 2:58:45 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): Even i feel its unethical sharing personal details without asking the person unless it helps other person in getting sum business out of it
[17/09/18, 3:00:38 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): So here’s what we can possibly do - pls do share the purpose when anyone wants a contact / lead so the person having the info can figure how to go about it . Sounds reasonable?
[17/09/18, 3:04:06 PM] Sakshi Rastogi (91): + As a standard practice what I typically do is I check with the person whose contact I am passing along if they are okay. If I absolutely definitely know this person wouldn't mind the connection coming through, I pass on the contact irrespective. People I don't know personally but might be of help.. giving their work email id works best. All of that on pm.
[17/09/18, 3:06:02 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): agree, email or contact on pm is a better way rather then sharing to whole group

It is great connecting with you all!
[Too Long but Do Read]

I am looking for people who are interested in building their personal brand for a huge, untapped audience in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

In terms of numbers, urban India with an estimated population of 455 million already has 295 million using the internet. While, Rural India, i.e., Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and villages, with an estimated population of 918 million, has only 186 million internet users. Thus, there are 732 potential million users still in rural India. 

These numbers seem mindboggling right?

Also, here's the catch: The internet is built for a native English speaking audience. If this is not enough, there is a huge content gap for the rural audiences as well.

And for Content Creators, the bigger problem is of competition on already famous platforms like Youtube.

Hence, I am here asking for as many connects as possible.

Of whom, you may ask? 

I am looking for New and Upcoming 
Experts
LinkedIN Influencers
Bloggers
Instagrammers
Youtubers
Facebookers 
who want to come on board and create content, build their brands, be the first movers, and become famous amongst the untapped 900 million Indians out there.

What is a First Mover Advantage?

Superwoman Lilly Singh- joined Youtube in 2010 and has 14 million+ subscribers today. Youtube was only taking off in 2009 in the USA.

When Youtube came to India with full force in 2014, Bhuvan Bam started his channel in 2015 and now has over 10 million subscribers!

But both of them joined Youtube when it had just started gaining traction in their respective countries. That's your First Mover Advantage. As the years went by, the numbers only compounded.

If you can see the potential in this vision, please fill out the form below. You can also forward this to people who you know are working towards building their personal brand and want to reach a massive audience!

https://goo.gl/forms/hIkSl2bC4aYgUpIx2

My team will get in touch with you as soon as possible. Cheers to all of you hardworking content creators!

And Thank you so much for your time!

[20/09/18, 12:59:06 AM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Trello with its color coded lists, member based assignments and various power-ups can be very useful for this... Pls see their own blogs and how-to articles on using it effectively... You can directly create Trello tasks from email or add repetitive tasks too. From my personal experience, I can vouch for it. I use it for all my personal things...
[20/09/18, 1:07:08 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Hi everyone, Prathamesh this side, I know everybody is acutely aware of the problems people face when they wish to receive blood. From politics to blood mafia everyone is making it a commercial activity and innocent lives are damaged in this blood lust.. 

A few years ago, a few friends and myself worked on something to solve this problem and were faced with similar threats. Thanks to pushstart, ive met alot of people who have tried to do something similar and are still doing things in their personal capacity to solve this problem. 

I am seeking to connect to all such people who have tried solving this problems, through technology, NGOs or any other means!

Planning to unite them all and do something to have a huge impact. Pls DM me if you have the zeal, the passion and have tried solving this problem or tag someone you know who might be willing to collaborate and make this big!

Pushstart can do this!

[22/09/18, 5:02:19 PM] Kiran Reddy (ps): Helm of Eight is proud to present a workshop series on personal and professional development facilitated by Amit Mishra from Eight App India (Sansan, Japan). 

Our Agenda is to better understand the power of Networking, Influencing and Negotiating. To create serendipity that can lead to personal and professional growth.

To move from a place of default to guided, from an amateur to professional, from sheer luck/coincidence to paving the perfect career path for yourself.

---------------------
Schedule:

11:00 am-11:30 am – Ice Breaking session + introductions
11:30 am - 12:30 pm – Guided discussions and interactions on the essentials of networking and different scenarios 
12:30 pm - 1:00 pm – A Role-Play activity amongst the attendees to instil the three legs of our agenda – Networking, Influencing and Negotiating

---------------------
Who should attend?

Anyone who feels they can make something better of themselves

•	College Students
•	Young Graduates 
•	Start-up Enthusiasts 
•	Start-up Founders
•	Working Professionals

---------------------
What can you expect to gain?

•	To get answers to your questions on Networking, Gaining Influence, Exerting Influence, Effective Negotiation (creating Win-Win scenarios)
•	To learn how to make meaningful connections and influence your way to your chosen career path

---------------------
Why should you attend? What can we learn together:

•	The power to understand and take informed decisions on various career choices
•	Power vs Influence
•	Difference between impression and influence
•	Is networking making a connection?
•	Negotiations can be one sided, mutual or orchestrated

Having a network is not merely about knowing names of people or their designation or even their companies – it’s about making authentic connections and the ability to make an impression.

The subtlety of creating an impression and honing the ability to influence - Do you know the benefits? Do you know the pitfalls? 

Learn the difference between one sided, mutual or orchestrated negotiation

[26/09/18, 12:53:29 AM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): Collaboration with Creators is a two way street.

The first one involves an idea for a sketch or series which they really want to produce and while writing the script they leave integration points for staple Brands across sectors. In this case they usually charge Brands on the basis of share of voice like 30%, 50% or more

The higher the share of voice, count of active integration the bigger ticket size in terms of cost.

The other way is to share a brief with them and tell them what you want to achieve, they get back with an idea for a single sketch or an entire series with subtle integrations for your Brand/Business

As far as I know for a five episode series TVF quotes 80L-1Cr , Girliyapa would be around 40-50 , Timeliners would do it for 30-35

SIT the last I remember pitches in for around 6-8 Lacs per episode
[26/09/18, 12:53:32 AM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): I hope this helps

[26/09/18, 10:32:44 AM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): The focus of Marketing teams is to explore B2B audience like Brand Managers and CMO's, in my understanding they don't indulge in barters unless it's another media firm with a new audience that they can explore or reach out to
[26/09/18, 10:33:57 AM] Sahana Rai (ps): Ohh ok great. That helps 😊. Thanks Hitesh

[06/10/18, 11:41:24 AM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): I meant the going rates for these Ads, minimum amount to be invested etc.
[06/10/18, 11:44:41 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): https://www.themediaant.com/
[06/10/18, 11:44:58 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): Bro, please dont' invest in them. I get too irritated with those ads
[06/10/18, 11:45:02 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): At 1 am in night - badshah masala!
[06/10/18, 11:45:04 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): please
[06/10/18, 11:45:56 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Lol
[06/10/18, 11:49:25 AM] Ameet (pushstart): Lol
[06/10/18, 11:52:40 AM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Hahaha, I am just curious
[06/10/18, 11:53:24 AM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): It's a good way for any co. Focused on reaching masses
[06/10/18, 11:57:00 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): There should be a way to switch off ads. The problem with Local Train ads is - you are trapped in crowd - frustrated and scolding your life and in the middle of all this stink, you are standing just below that speaker where the announcements come - "Pav Bhaji, Chat Masala, - Badshah Masal" and if your journey is from Churchgate to Bhayandar, the user will be tortured with ads for like 100 times with no option to switch it off. Its like concentration camp. Its forced pathetic form of marketing.
[06/10/18, 11:57:15 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): no offense Anurag, I am just tired of this marketing mode and hence venting out.
[06/10/18, 11:58:10 AM] Gautam (pushstart): In which the outcome can't be measured 😦
[06/10/18, 11:58:57 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): Its negative. Trust me. People start hating the  product. They cannot hate or discontinue railway as its not replaceble but they start hating product.
[06/10/18, 11:59:02 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): I use everest masale now.
[06/10/18, 11:59:43 AM] Ritu Mittal (ps): Haha! Major vent scenes ! 

However ambient marketing is suppose to be noisy. But yes not each and every day. There has to be an end date to it. What would be ideal if while the announcement is made the women selling wares within the train are also selling the masala packs. Effective BTL.
[06/10/18, 12:00:30 PM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): 👍👍
[06/10/18, 12:00:47 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): Hahaha.. so someone WILL benefit from the advertising ;)
[06/10/18, 12:01:30 PM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): hahahaha. to kill competitor - run their marketing campaign ATL and BTL in a bad manner :)
[06/10/18, 12:04:01 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): 😂
[06/10/18, 12:04:38 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): For all the venting that we do, it will be interesting to see a Before-After study on increase in brand recall. 

Most advertising on railway stations, buses, trains and even airlines doesn't work because the 'audience' comprises of frequent travelers, who over time, learn to zone out all advertising around them.

Just like most of us can't recall all TV ads or all digital banners on our phones

[06/10/18, 12:17:58 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Doesn't work....is a wrong metrics. Attention for all we care is about stating the obvious or as the purpose is "Getting attention". Even in a subconscious way.

They way to measure is also the fact that you are starting about it.

It's about GETTING attention, that's why Housing.com got the attention it wanted and not the traffic.

Sure the targeting and the copy can be changed. But it cannot be deeply personalized, and that's the nature of ambient marketing.
[06/10/18, 12:20:24 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): For which you ofcourse have CTAs which can vary case to case from sending an SMS to liking a page to following on insta,to giving a miss-call or even asking you if you have a disease :).

[06/10/18, 1:57:46 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): If i may, the purpose of such ads is not CTA, It's not about metrics to them but about branding and imprinting brand identity into subconscious mind
[06/10/18, 2:22:42 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): Yes. Sure
[06/10/18, 2:41:13 PM] Lakhan (Womaniya): Need to make a video for fb ad for app installs, anyone with insights on what/how to make?

[06/10/18, 3:25:27 PM] Lakhan (Womaniya): Need to consult someone for the idea part of the ad, execution will be done.

[06/10/18, 6:24:45 PM] Hasan Sunara (pushstart): Hi Pushstarters, Any  Visa consultants here? 
 
I am Hasan Sunasara from Ahmedabad, a Software Consultant.

I am on a mission to make a Visa consultant's life easy. So far, I have identified some of the problem areas and implemented a solution for:

1. Apply Visa - Capture candidate's details and documents online
2. Generate Embassy Form - Auto filled embassy form in PDF format
3. Check Visa Status
4. Receive payment online
5. Email notifications

I am currently working on an important and a bigger challenge of making an integration with the embassy systems such as making an application, appointment booking etc. so that a Consultant's system remains a single point of contact for a candidate.

Would you like to contribute by giving your views on the above and any other challenges you face in your daily activities?

If it's feasible to converse, please let me know your suited time to talk/communicate/chat for a few minutes. Thanks.

Appreciate any reference. Please DM.

[11/10/18, 4:37:01 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): They are not too responsive and don't provide choice for no.s
[11/10/18, 4:37:52 PM] ‪+91 97655 95163‬: Please don't opt for Vodafone. Not worrth. Network goes bonkers
[11/10/18, 4:38:02 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Go to a Voda store and ask for premium number
[11/10/18, 4:39:26 PM] Anurag Jagia (pushstart): Unfortunately I get voda network only in my building coz they have installed a new tower here. 🤦‍♂
[11/10/18, 4:42:57 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): This is best option
[11/10/18, 4:43:05 PM] Amrik (pushstart): They do not offer fresh numbers in prepaid. All numbers are used and surrendered. Fresh numbers are reserved for post paid subscribers. Check on Truecaller before you take a prepaid number. You may get some weird names of the previous user of the number. Names like “Kalia Bihar” or “Jaggia Alibag” is a possibility
[11/10/18, 4:43:50 PM] Amrik (pushstart): And you wil wonder why people are not taking your call 😁
[11/10/18, 4:44:02 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): You get such name in post paid too

[11/10/18, 4:55:05 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Jio too
[11/10/18, 5:00:47 PM] Amrik (pushstart): All service providers suck. They do not have the bandwidth. Cannot buy additional bandwidth cause they are running losses
[11/10/18, 5:01:33 PM] Amrik (pushstart): Actually Jio should be better, but is not. I took a Jio sim and don’t use it

Location: Anywhere
Company: getbetterly
Benefits: Equity

Please PM me if you are interested or know someone needy here
[13/10/18, 8:31:19 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): full stack is i guess PHP, HTML and JavaScript right ?
[13/10/18, 8:32:26 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): react is just a front end language right ?
[13/10/18, 8:36:55 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): React Native. Yes. Front end of React, backend of Node and MySQL
[13/10/18, 8:37:00 AM] Salil (pushstart): Nope it is more like somebody who knows end to end development
[13/10/18, 8:37:03 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): No PHP
[13/10/18, 8:37:14 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): Right or willing to learn and do
[13/10/18, 8:37:31 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): so you need MEAN stack + React not full stack
[13/10/18, 8:39:20 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): I mean anybody who knows React JS and React Native. Backend is not a concern. Not MEAN stack.
[13/10/18, 8:40:00 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): ohk !
[13/10/18, 8:40:32 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): I need passionate developer who will not say that designing is not my thing or backend integration is not my forte. A go getter, a generalist
[13/10/18, 8:40:56 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): 50k per month + equity
[13/10/18, 8:41:52 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): but is that not counter productive ? honestly its best to have people do what they best rather than a generalist
[13/10/18, 8:42:55 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): cos a good dev need not be a good designer
[13/10/18, 8:43:59 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): Generalist in attitude. Not in skill. Open to do anything
[13/10/18, 8:44:14 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): That's why emphasis on React
[13/10/18, 8:44:45 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): and why react in that context ?
[13/10/18, 8:45:14 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): Because that is the tech stack already chosen by the company.
[13/10/18, 8:45:53 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): ohk
[13/10/18, 8:46:26 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): cos in my experience, especially in react, design input is very very crucial
[13/10/18, 8:46:39 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): I agree
[13/10/18, 8:46:43 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): Guys, looking for a full-time full stack developer:

[18/10/18, 5:30:38 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Neeraj , Only IT and Digital guy will know this word - *Saas* rest people , won't understand what is Saas and All , for them it is jargon word..
[18/10/18, 5:31:30 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Oh! it's not a jargon bro. It's an abbreviation
[18/10/18, 5:31:50 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): okie
[18/10/18, 5:35:20 PM] Neeraj Joshi: But I would agree. Many won't get it. But according to my analysis of our TG, all pushstarters should know what a SaaS is
[18/10/18, 5:36:21 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): SAAS is 'software as a service'. Basically, instead of owning a software you can just rent it for subscription. So instead of building a new software for your company that sends daily emails, you can use mailchimp.

Shameless promotion, but if you want such simple explanations to diverse concepts from economics, technology, game theory, physics etc subscribe to polygyan.com. I am gonna send out daily mails to help anyone get a broad knowledge of a lot of things.

(I hope this is OK @918779219493 ;))
[18/10/18, 5:37:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: haha ❤
[18/10/18, 5:40:18 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Zabardast explanation aditya...👌

We have 150 years of Ayurvedic legacy in our family and own 100 + fda approved proprietary Ayurvedic formulations (all ministry of Ayush approved and GMP certified). We’re now taking our age old formulations and repackaging them to appeal to modern consumers. Livitup (hangover shield) and Chakaash (goodness of chyawanprash in a toffee) are a few examples of how we’re taking 150 years of legacy to the 21st century. @918779219493 this gives context?

[22/10/18, 6:10:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: How?
[22/10/18, 6:12:12 PM] Ajit K Jain (ps): Pls also share data with me ..once you get..☺
[22/10/18, 6:13:30 PM] Shreeja (ps): Depends , if you are bombarding
Cold calls, sms ,emails
And that's  how email and sms marketing work
(Correct me if I am wrong)
[22/10/18, 6:13:58 PM] Shreeja (ps): Haha..sure there are vendors in the market
Most of them have very outdated data
[22/10/18, 6:14:33 PM] Shreeja (ps): So looking for recommendations, in case anyone has us3d
[22/10/18, 6:14:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: No it is actually not legal to send a message or email till the time the user haven’t subscribed to your services Atleast in Europe after GDPR
[22/10/18, 6:15:12 PM] Shreeja (ps): India!!!!
We are in India,😂
[22/10/18, 6:16:47 PM] Shreeja (ps): We do this here in India
I get close to 20 messages everyday
[22/10/18, 6:17:01 PM] Shreeja (ps): And countless mails, and calls
[22/10/18, 6:17:21 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha! Email and sms marketing are just different channels of marketing. They have nothing to do with Data
[22/10/18, 6:17:23 PM] Ajit K Jain (ps): Can anyone tell me best ways of marketing if one has 22k LinkedIn connections....
[22/10/18, 6:17:46 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Influencer marketing

[22/10/18, 6:20:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Use LinkedIn helper tool. Connect with @918953881643. He might be able to share his knowledge
[22/10/18, 6:20:10 PM] Shreeja (ps): We buy in some cases not necessarily own
Cz we are not talking about some 100's here
And an organization to build chunks of data , that takes some time
[22/10/18, 6:21:18 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): For anyone who is not clear about Data polices, Airtels bussiness model is called "minutes factory" where they marketed the fact that they have X number of people using their Networks. :).
[22/10/18, 6:23:04 PM] Shreeja (ps): Also depends on products  that we are dealing with, like a product where there is no refill or replacement, like a one time buy say a property..we dont  go buy every month..so in this scenario even after building an X no of data, it bevomes obsolete after a while, so how do we refresh
[22/10/18, 6:28:38 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): What i also meant was, do you post often & they like, comment on your post?
[22/10/18, 6:29:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hey, @919051541622 @919960058547 started this thread on FB on Data Buying/Selling. Lets take the discussion here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Pushstarter/permalink/1973169942743616/

[22/10/18, 7:14:04 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: I'll agree..Marketing is so much more creative and interesting than these gimmicks!
[22/10/18, 7:15:56 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its not that !
[22/10/18, 7:17:30 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): in my humble opinion marketing is not just about communicating, but its about creating a market for the product, understanding the demand and supply game, understanding market needs, fine tuning the product to cater to those needs, building a system of communication to reach out to the TG and then converting them into users/consumers/costumers
[22/10/18, 7:20:23 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): U r right. It is all of this and often so much more ..it's this broad idea of Mktg that often gets it into trouble & gives it a bad name.
[22/10/18, 7:22:05 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): people often get confused with marketing vs sales vs communication vs PR
[22/10/18, 7:23:26 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): The way I used to think of it was to invert the approach and think of what *actions or pursuits* does it cause the product/brand owner to take up.

I think it's all activities & actions  that build three  things:
1. Relevance
2. Preference
3. Influence

Building these into ur product/business *sequentially* helps to gain market share and profit growth among any audience.
[22/10/18, 7:25:19 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its good that way ! i am more of a backward  integration person, build the user/costumer/consumer profile and work back there to ideate the product, then build the prodct
[22/10/18, 7:26:29 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): It works in all kinds of product and service categories, for big businesses and for startups.

I gained immensely from this, partly because it helped keep a sharp focus on consumer benefits and it was easier to get the team aligned to metrics like these. 

U can't cheat on this stuff 😉
[22/10/18, 7:26:31 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): Interesting .. especially since I have been studying this way for quite some time now. Happy to read your inputs here
[22/10/18, 7:27:39 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): Yep. That's the first point.. Building Relevance!
[22/10/18, 7:27:41 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): 😃
[22/10/18, 7:28:49 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): so i am student of economics and one thing i have always understood is the game of demand and supply, the root of success is not carpet bombing but understanding if the product is needed today, understanding its latency, its relevance, purchasing power of audience, the kind of demand it has, is it need based or want based !

- Consistent, detail oriented and reliable since all deliverables are deadline based

[23/10/18, 6:57:31 PM] Ankur Pandey (ps): Folks, need some help in creating an elevator pitch. We need to create a pitch of the following format (for https://UnFound.news)

*For [customers] that have [problem x] we [what you do].*

An example for a startup RentMonitor:

_For landlords who are overcome with the burden of managing rental properties, RentMonitor provides a web platform that allows automation of many commonly occurring manual tasks such as rent collection & maintenance requests._

*Please send your suggestions at the earliest. We shall be grateful, tx*
[23/10/18, 6:58:06 PM] Ankur Pandey (ps): Here's a long-ish summary about UnFound:

An intelligent news insights platform. UnFound’s AI helps users consume quality news in a short time- by providing them with diverse sides to complex topics, non-mainstream perspectives, rich context/background behind the news, etc.

We were interested to solve misinformation problem since years. Lately (esp post Trump)- lot of media attention has been on ‘fake news’. But we think that deeper & more complex problems are *false narratives* & *echo chambers*- which UnFound is trying to solve.

Although a general platform- we focus more on politics, economics, business, tech news, as well as topics which interests college / higher education students.

The UnFound (B2C) app extracts the insights via our AI engine. This makes us fast, scalable, and reduces bias.

[25/10/18, 4:48:45 PM] Ayush Garg (ps): Sharing my referral code here. Thanks.
[25/10/18, 4:48:52 PM] Ayush Garg (ps): This is a new currency and payment network built by ex-PayPal guys, called Initiative Q. The Q currency is currently being allocated for free if you are invited by an existing member.

The idea is that if millions of people join, Q could become a leading payment network, and, according to well-known economic models, that means the value of the reward would be around $130,000.

The amount you reserve decreases every day, and each member has a limited number of invites. 

You can use my invite link here: 
https://initiativeq.com/invite/re1oHQk2m

(Don’t worry. No funny stuff. You just need to give your name and email and your spot is reserved).
[25/10/18, 4:53:12 PM] Harshal (uberpass): Already shared
[25/10/18, 4:56:06 PM] ‪+91 96199 66319‬: Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Here is my invite link: https://initiativeq.com/invite/rNJ2Fzy37

 This link will stop working once I’m out of invites. Let me know after you registered, because I need to verify you on my end.

Great to see people interested in this new payment system from this group.

Enthusiasts from Mumbai, the finance capital of the country, never let go on fintech opportunities. Kudos.

I will provide everything, but I need to build a prototype first and then be charged for every product I get built. Something like a dropshipping model.

Is that possible? Any body who has leads? Who should I partner with?

[27/10/18, 12:57:34 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): Decathlon has a no-gear bike at 5k .. if u r just getting started, that's worth the money.. great quality and VFM ..

Prob with cycling in Mumbai is finding 'safe' roads to ride it ;)
[27/10/18, 12:59:09 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): It's true.. for most sports  hobbyists, it has great products at right prices.. and the stuff lasts longer than the hobby 😉

[27/10/18, 1:01:29 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Yup decathlon is good.. but if someone is buying a bike for the first time..  I usually suggest them to go with second hand ones before investing heavily into a good bike..  this is to ensure ur interest doesn't fizzle out ..
[27/10/18, 1:02:08 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): U will get amazing deals from biking enthusiasts like me who buy a brand new one and than realise after a month that it's not a goto hobby 🤣🤣🤣
[27/10/18, 1:02:36 PM] shashank (pushstart): Haha they don't give it that easily I had my eyes set on Firebox.
[27/10/18, 1:03:45 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Dhundo..milega.. Firefox sells a lot of bikes and I don't see half of tjem on roads early morning or late nights ..

Neeraj this side, the one who started Pushstart! 

We have come a long way from being an idea discussion platform to a community which helps you to grow your business. 

We are planning a few interesting things for the community. 

But before implementing them I would like to understand the current problems that you as pushstarters are facing and what can be done to solve them. 

Over this weekend I am planning to meet the maximum possible pushstarters to gain insights and feedback on the existing version of ps. 

If you can spare 30 mins of your time tomorrow or day after tomorrow, I would love to meet you over coffee. 

Do ping me if you would like to help and grow this community further.

[02/11/18, 11:25:40 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Couple of suggestions:

1. Open up paid memberships forum for the access to all the information other than the one's which is publicly accessible.

2. Every referral must be documented in google doc amongst representative of pushstart, receiptent and offerer and loyallty points or rewards has to be raised for the help. It would involve criterion decisions based on: 
1. Best fit for purpose
2. Step down resource
3. Relatively managed

[02/11/18, 11:28:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 🤩🤩
[02/11/18, 11:28:57 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Good one
[02/11/18, 11:29:44 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): @919820515267  has been conducting quite a few workshops on the same
[02/11/18, 11:29:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I am working on the first one. 2nd one is very very important. Will work on that.
[02/11/18, 11:35:03 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Love u bhai for the feedback 😘😘
[02/11/18, 11:37:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Any connects in box8? Was looking forward to connect with the founders. Kindly pm 🙏🙏
[02/11/18, 11:41:43 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Built the first community in real estate space at commonfloor and now implementing at Leher.

Its a tough job to gather people and bring them on the same page. People are where they are hustling in life but when you are done building a community they should be with you with a single objective.

Building community doesn't restrict to gathering contacts, discussion forums, AMAs and mutual connects. Every whatsapp group does this. As an entrepreneur, you might have to spend some time to reward the time and energy spent by all the PUSHSTARTERs.
[02/11/18, 11:42:40 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes true. That’s why started with #Pushcontributors for contribution on fb
[02/11/18, 11:43:33 PM] Neeraj Joshi: It’s really hard to track contribution on whatsapp.  Needs tech interference
[02/11/18, 11:43:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: And also requires man power
[02/11/18, 11:44:35 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Here you killed it. Good one ! I'm glad my message is now finally conveyed. Good night.
[02/11/18, 11:49:58 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 😀
[02/11/18, 11:53:58 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): My suggestion would be
Make a dedicated forum where people can come and search things and you can host all things on your own domain. With this.. people can contribute and we can categorise things properly because here and fb both makes all things cumbersome - if you want I can contribute..
[02/11/18, 11:54:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: true. bhai pm
[02/11/18, 11:57:01 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Anyone here a range of female centric products I can gift in Diwali ?

[03/11/18, 12:17:54 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 👍🏻
[03/11/18, 12:18:47 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Should we invite the chayoos guy for the AMA?
[03/11/18, 12:18:53 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What do you guys think?
[03/11/18, 12:21:58 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Invite bhai ...want to know their marketing strategy on food
[03/11/18, 12:22:29 AM] Neeraj Joshi: are they doing good?
[03/11/18, 12:22:38 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Go for Facebook live session instead to AmA...
[03/11/18, 12:23:23 AM] Neeraj Joshi: obviously bro
[03/11/18, 12:25:26 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Not so much but m not sure ..I been 2 their outlet twice found their tea very very ordinary like tapri chai ...in facts our tapri chai is much better than chayoos...I felt their ambience was nice but the products categories and hospitality goes down on taste ...Hope u guy don't felt bad m sharing my experience as I am big addicted to *Chai*
[03/11/18, 1:13:14 AM] Keshav Arora (ps): marketing strategy is very good actually. They portray it as Indian Starbucks, same level of ambiance and snacks; just Indian touch and cheaper
[03/11/18, 1:14:21 AM] Keshav Arora (ps): There is an outlet at the Mumbai Demostic Airport, right next to Starbucks and Chaayos is almost always more filled up. 😜
[03/11/18, 1:19:54 AM] Lakhan (Womaniya): Agreed that they are positioning themselves as the Indian Starbucks,the target audience is the same, just enticing them with chai v/s coffee, chai = chaayos, coffee = Starbucks, and everyone knows what Indians are more crazy about!
[03/11/18, 1:21:31 AM] Lakhan (Womaniya): In their airport outlet, they have a cabin, available for renting on hourly basis, targeting the corporate segment very well, who might just stay at the airport for work.
[03/11/18, 1:23:01 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I honestly prefer chaayos to Starbucks in terms of comfort and ambience, I am a coffee person but the food and overall feel is better there. But they can learn service from Starbucks
[03/11/18, 1:24:29 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Marketing wise, they have done some good work, especially the option to buy bulk tea is something I love about them
[03/11/18, 1:24:56 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I can order tea for a whole office from chaayos which no one else offers for that pricing

[03/11/18, 7:32:10 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Chayoos - Neeraj, do not look at it as a startup. Here the perpetual growth can be predicted with the daily in and out flow. We term such ventures as High Growth Businessess. 

Invite him and start a conversation 
1. why he didn't choose to be a startup ? I'm sure, It will be an Interesting conversation.

2. What is the focus for them ? Vertical or Horizontal Integration ? 

3. QA/QC tech and assessment ?

Happy Diwali to you ALL! 
In this auspicious occasion, we would like to #PushLaunch *PushConnect*! 
*Why PushConnect?*
The most common FEEDBACK after personally interacting with 150+ Pushstarters in the last 1 month was: 
You guys are doing an amazing job online but do start some initiative which will increase the OFFLINE engagement between pushstarters. 

It will lead to more Collaborations, Partnerships, and Conversions for pushstarters! 

And here we are launching PUSHCONNECT! 

Will share more details tonight! Stay Tuned!

[10/11/18, 6:15:16 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): better search for insta influencer
[10/11/18, 6:15:21 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): they reply at least
[10/11/18, 6:18:36 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): YouTube influencers have become too overrated . I contacted many people in past and some of the bigger ones charge way out of their league and funny part being they don’t even give you Analytics of past advertising.
I got in touch with BYN and they said they charge 15 lakhs+GST and they don’t have any data of past advertisers
[10/11/18, 6:18:58 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): hahha
[10/11/18, 6:19:03 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Then I went with 2-3 people and they gave almost nil ROI
[10/11/18, 6:19:06 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): agree with your words bhai
[10/11/18, 6:20:41 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): To be true even Instagram is too costly. Beerbiceps is a YouTuber and he charges 4 lakhs for 1 insta post and 1 lakh for insta story
[10/11/18, 6:20:47 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I was like wtf
[10/11/18, 6:21:57 PM] Abodid (pushstart): I was wondering if they are so overrated why do the clients pay that much ? Any idea ?
[10/11/18, 6:22:20 PM] shashank (pushstart): Hahaha! And then they say account hacked and sell it off to someone else.
[10/11/18, 6:22:23 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Because they think they get sales through this people 😂
[10/11/18, 6:22:33 PM] shashank (pushstart): Ask for who paid !
[10/11/18, 6:23:03 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Because user like me spend most of the time on YT.
[10/11/18, 6:23:07 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I run a marketing company.. I always explain this to my client that rather invest in google and fb ads but they always want influencer marketing
[10/11/18, 6:23:09 PM] Gaurav Naini (ps): I got similar quotes. 4 lakh for the video. 1 Lakh for Instapost. 80k for story 😂
[10/11/18, 6:23:25 PM] Abodid (pushstart): May be ,. They might be getting sales as well.. 

Or may be a brand recognition and fan base
[10/11/18, 6:23:28 PM] Kria Doshi (ps): What do you want them for?
[10/11/18, 6:23:29 PM] shashank (pushstart): I know that Juhi Godambe she takes money from brands used same to have her own label Arabella. So try feeding them less and make them your own competitor
[10/11/18, 6:25:16 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Yea compared to this, Facebook marketing seems dirt cheap
[10/11/18, 6:25:19 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): If a influencer really gives or not .. it’s very important for so called brand influencers to give data of past advertisers but they don’t even bother to keep it which makes it look very unprofessional

[10/11/18, 6:25:48 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Aromas of India is the new luxury home fragrance brand started by a friend.
[10/11/18, 6:26:01 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Can someone elaborate on this through examples though ? Like I want to know , given how cheap Facebook marketing is, is it really effective ?
[10/11/18, 6:26:03 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: There were some influencers in the group i remember
[10/11/18, 6:26:21 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Spend that money in google ads way better
[10/11/18, 6:26:53 PM] Sahana Rai (ps): Do it only if influencers are willing to do barter collaboration
[10/11/18, 6:27:06 PM] shashank (pushstart): Check Soulflower they start with small medium influencers and survive on them. They work with only those who do on barter basis.

[10/11/18, 6:30:51 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 🤤
[10/11/18, 6:31:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: FB ads for awareness, Google ads for conversion. Thats the general norm
[10/11/18, 6:32:19 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Not totally true
[10/11/18, 6:32:29 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Fb ads also convert.. depends on the product
[10/11/18, 6:32:40 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): .
[10/11/18, 6:32:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: yes tabhi. General Norm bola
[10/11/18, 6:33:35 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): I don't know, but Media buys from these influencers stuff, doesn't really sail too far. It works vanity, toh data won't help much.
[10/11/18, 6:34:40 PM] Neeraj Joshi: its tooooooooo generic a question. Which product? How do you define effectiveness? What is cheap according to you?
[10/11/18, 6:35:30 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Also, it's not about a channel being cheap. It should fit your unit economics. Thats it
[10/11/18, 6:35:47 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Product is a web app, think Fo something similar to hackerrank. Effectiveness is getting new users to sign up on the platform.
[10/11/18, 6:35:51 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: True
[10/11/18, 6:36:15 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Agreed
[10/11/18, 6:36:30 PM] Neeraj Joshi: pm
[10/11/18, 6:36:35 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Facebook marketing isn’t cheap. Yeah they do provide ads budget as low as ₹40 but that isn’t real fb ads marketing. ₹40 or any amount for that is just for testing the waters and with ₹40 you can get likes etc but won’t give any sort of sales..
For sales normally it’s good budget
[10/11/18, 6:37:11 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): omg
[10/11/18, 6:37:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: He was ready to do an AMA on Pushstart for free though :P
[10/11/18, 6:38:17 PM] Neeraj Joshi: But 15mins AMA 😂
[10/11/18, 6:38:29 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Wow 😂
[10/11/18, 6:38:32 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Influencer economy is a huge potential market. Only going to get bigger. People are building billion dollar companies now just through their network influence.
[10/11/18, 6:40:12 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): I tried out a promotion (fir the first time) on Facebook yesterday. To promote a post having a link to the sign up button for my platform. For 5k it's estimating around 3k clicks in a month.  I think thats fairly cheap. Perhaps I don't know much about the space yet probably. Glad if you could tell me more if I'm wrong
[10/11/18, 6:40:56 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I think it’s the other way round. Now influencer marketing has become very bad because of so many daily so called stars coming daily.
They become famous through this new social media tiktok etc and they charge huge so nobody comes to advertise again 😂
[10/11/18, 6:41:51 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I think great content + good targeting = more efficient cheap conversions?

Would love your views
[10/11/18, 6:42:59 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Hmm.. But supply vs Demand. They are charging high coz there are people who are paying them that much. Which means less supply more demand. When the supply increases, the prices will be cheaper
[10/11/18, 6:43:16 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I need to see the ad set and then can comment..
3k clicks is good but how much signup you got? So have to see it then.. we can talk in pm
[10/11/18, 6:43:56 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Okay thanks. I'll message you in a bit :)
[10/11/18, 6:44:03 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I was reading a piece, which says that very soon YouTubers and Instagram stars will have enough influence that they can run and win for govt positions. YouTuber will become a president
[10/11/18, 6:44:15 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): 😅
[10/11/18, 6:45:15 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Subscribers aren't equivalent to supporters haha
[10/11/18, 6:45:23 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): If you see happn app was one of our ex client who came to me for some sort of marketing.. 
They themselves said that they paid this big influencers to even promote them and booked for 2-3 videos blindly but they didn’t get proper response!
They lost a lot of money
[10/11/18, 6:46:10 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Hmm
[10/11/18, 6:46:18 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I get your point.
[10/11/18, 6:46:49 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Haha I know. But a few can use the channel to convert to supporters.
[10/11/18, 6:47:50 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Waldoo for president. We have donald and Modiji.

[10/11/18, 7:17:00 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): Of course, I just started out a few months ago. If one is creating value for people and influencing them to make choices, one qualifies to be called an influencer. I am happy with so many women already writing to me and thanking me for showing them options in skincare, make up tutorials and yoga/ wellness content too.

[10/11/18, 7:18:24 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): 😂😂😂 bade kaam ke
[10/11/18, 7:19:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha! But that somewhat dilutes the definition of an influencer. There should be a number and that number should not be in the thousands, otherwise every damn person will call themselves a influencer 🤣
[10/11/18, 7:20:11 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: It's in 1000s
[10/11/18, 7:20:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Everyone of us have Atleast 1k friends across social platforms combined, so Everyone is an influencer? 😍
[10/11/18, 7:22:55 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I need beta testers for our new to launch - url Shortener which you can use to add pixels and use the data to retarget your product to users.. 
people who will help me out will get 1 year of subscription of the tool for free
[10/11/18, 7:27:01 PM] shashank (pushstart): Sounds good! I can. DMing you
[10/11/18, 7:27:08 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Perfect
[10/11/18, 7:27:54 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Can you please explain the term add pixels.
[10/11/18, 7:28:34 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Sure will be happy to
[10/11/18, 7:29:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Me
[10/11/18, 7:31:20 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): There’s a website that tells you your financial worth as an influencer. Social blue? I will chk n get back. But yeah, I’d also like to know if there’s a set parameter to qualify to be called an “influencer “ Having said that, brands are already getting in touch with me based on the content they see , despite the subscribers being less than 2k. So I am happy 😊
[10/11/18, 7:32:48 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): So fb and and many other ad networks provide pixels 
We insert that pixel into a link.. so you normally put pixels inside your website and you retarget them who visit your site.. this has been biggest limitation till now..
So with our url Shortener.. you can overcome it
Assume that I am yourstory competition.. what I will do is.. I will share yourstory with the pixel based url Shortener and I capture the data of the audience who clicks on that link.. now I got the perfect audience of yourstory in my fb custom audience and then I just simple run an ad and voila you get proper targeted traffic..
[10/11/18, 7:33:20 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Thanks bhai.. will pm
[10/11/18, 7:34:00 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): True.

[10/11/18, 7:41:30 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Oh ok got it, Thanks for explaining
[10/11/18, 7:41:58 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Welcome 😊
[10/11/18, 7:43:04 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): And when they buy stuff I recommend ? 🙂 and send me pics of products they bought, and tell me my tips made their skin better? That they got better sleep after following the video? What else does the term influencing mean🙂

[10/11/18, 8:00:06 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): That's awesome.. if ppl buy bec u recommend something, u can simply charge brands as percentage of sales.. takes away the whole need to argue abt level of influence and in-between metrics !
[10/11/18, 8:03:16 PM] Neeraj Joshi: That I too would agree :)
[10/11/18, 8:03:25 PM] Shabia Walia (ps): I agree. Good Content Creation is far imp than just having millions of subscribers. As a brand owner, smeone who takes my product, and creates valuable content around it is that creates an impact is far more imp than thousands of people seeing it with no impact.

It will depend on a lot of factors, like engagement, demographics of followers, purchasing power of followers, match between client and influencer's audience etc. I have been thinking about this for some time. There is a definite gap in the market.
[11/11/18, 8:36:55 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): ✌😍
[11/11/18, 8:38:28 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Don't Facebook pages already have those kind of insights ?
[11/11/18, 8:38:40 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Sure, Glad that you are part of the amazing community 😊
[11/11/18, 8:39:12 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): It'll be helpful for Instagram I guess. It doesn't have any such thing as far as I know
[11/11/18, 8:39:20 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Yes, but you as a business can't see it. Only the page owner can see it. Think of it like those insights, except you can see it for 10-20 influencers and then chose where best to put your money.
[11/11/18, 8:39:32 PM] Aditya Dwivedi (ps): Oh okay, makes sense
[11/11/18, 8:40:36 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): And it also takes your business into account, so for example if you sell b2b products, the matching score for an influencer who vlogs about travel will be very low. So kind of a relative scoring mechanism.
[11/11/18, 8:45:20 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): You can :)
[11/11/18, 8:45:56 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Couple of players out there have this.
[11/11/18, 8:47:22 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Like which? It is just one of the ideas in my head, haven't put more thought or research into it
[11/11/18, 8:55:28 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): For starters, sprinklr, meltwater, tribe, spredfast
[11/11/18, 8:56:30 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): But these are expensive ones, meltwater charges 6L for a year for 1 license.
[11/11/18, 8:59:48 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Wow that's a lot
[11/11/18, 8:59:56 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Thanks!

[11/11/18, 10:27:54 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): We just got our tech lead to revamping. I had build this site in 48 hrs to get 100 speakers so it is still in beta.
[11/11/18, 10:28:17 PM] Divyam Vaid Samachar Live (ps): Hi Nikhil,

[12/11/18, 11:04:02 AM] Bharatwaj (ps): Hi,
I have a doubt.. do you think the things which you wrote can be learnt?
Because my doubt is that.. many of the people who are running here successful business never went to such schools before.. then why so much such classes have come up?
Is problem solving and critical thinking a thing which can be solved?
I think entrepreneurship is becoming the next MBBS,engineering that parents will force you to study inspite of no interest in it..
I am not doubting your capabilities but asking a doubt..
[12/11/18, 11:06:39 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): +q
[12/11/18, 11:06:43 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): +1*
[12/11/18, 11:12:51 AM] ‪+91 96198 19518‬: As a student of the upcoming field of SEL (social emotional learning) I understand that such skills can be learnt and there are some global programs that have been tested for effectiveness by social researchers.
[12/11/18, 11:14:44 AM] Ashish Deora (pushstart): I agree. if some bandwidth can be freed from current crapy education process then yes.
[12/11/18, 11:21:43 AM] Kria Doshi (ps): The things I wrote can be developed and not learnt.  Definitely people are running successful business here, even though they haven't learnt such things because they have understood the importance of these skills now. The research on the subject and skills says so that it required for today's generation to acquire these skills. Also, Entrepreneurship is a generic subject, unlike engineering and MBBS. It won't give you a specific degree to pursue a particular profession. Infact it helps you in whatever profession/business you are into.
[12/11/18, 11:24:43 AM] Kria Doshi (ps): Also, the people who teach engineering or MBBS sometime have not been into that lrofession but they have just acquire knowledge about the same but still they are into teaching those. 
In entrepreneurship, usually the scene is entrepreneurs themselves are mentors and facilitators for  the subject.
[12/11/18, 11:52:11 AM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: Hi everyone!

[12/11/18, 7:59:40 PM] Priyanka Desai (ps): Totally agree! Love the way they keep the audience hooked. 
Indeed content creators must learn this from them.
[12/11/18, 8:01:15 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Absolutely. And how Kylie Jenner turned 250K investment into a billion dollar company with 7 full time & 5 part time employees is also a lesson in itself
[12/11/18, 8:03:42 PM] Priyanka Desai (ps): Yeah! The crazy fans buying her products that get sold within hours of the launch!
Loads to learn from the way they do their PR aswell. 🙃
[12/11/18, 8:17:31 PM] Hitesh Mehta (pushstart): Hi Guys,

A client of mine needs some content to be translated in to Marathi and also their is a video (whiteboard animation) with english voice over, that needs a Marathi voice over too.

Any leads? pls pm me.
[12/11/18, 8:23:55 PM] Harshal (uberpass): I have known many other make brands who have better quality products than Kylie.. But its again the brand face which is selling better than the product itself.
[12/11/18, 8:25:09 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Branding is very important.
[12/11/18, 8:25:58 PM] Priyanka Desai (ps): Exactly. According to the reports, their products are mediocre. Yet fans go crazy over them.  Brand face/branding sure is the winner here.

[20/11/18, 10:56:49 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Thank you ❤️
[20/11/18, 10:56:51 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Nice video bhavi...all parts are amazing but I felt who above the Hindi...if videos are only in English you will be missing out on your Hindi subscribers ..

This was main reason I started with my Facebook group with all videos in Hindi only .
[20/11/18, 10:57:16 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Good insight
[20/11/18, 10:57:32 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): We will look into it
Thank you for the feedback
[20/11/18, 10:59:15 PM] Rakhee Chabaria (ps): Congratulations dr Bhavi , way to go !
[20/11/18, 11:00:31 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): Good to see you here, Neha..welcome to the group
[20/11/18, 11:01:08 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): How many of you know folks at friends at wework BKC?
[20/11/18, 11:01:50 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): I tell you one strategies ...Been in Social media marketing ..

It would be quite hectic one this will work. 

1) Make three video ( I know video editing and making is big issue ) .

2) Make English video to post on LinkedIn to attract Corporate crowd .

3) Hindi video for complete nation (this will include those people who are shy and unable to express themselves in English speaking group .)

3) Regional Language video to catch that particular video. EG .u launch health video in gujrati ..u will get that regional crowd ..
[20/11/18, 11:06:01 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Thank you Rakhee
[20/11/18, 11:08:14 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Will think about it.
As you mentioned shoot and edit is painstaking.
3 videos is triple investment.
Too huge it becomes.
The idea is great,but Abhi out of reach.
Will surely work on it once we have some growth and revenue
[20/11/18, 11:15:38 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Subscribed
[20/11/18, 11:16:09 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Thank you
[20/11/18, 11:25:26 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): Hey Nirav, Where do you suggest these 3 videos with different languages be shared pls ... english on linkedin, and the hindi & regional one? I have been pondering on this for a while. I also want to make hindi content but CANNOT possibly have another whole channel for it 😳
[20/11/18, 11:26:45 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Aparna people I know who do hindi content have a seperate channel
[20/11/18, 11:27:01 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): That's the difficulty.
[20/11/18, 11:27:40 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Aparna do share your feedback, it will help us since you are already into it.
[20/11/18, 11:32:37 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): I am super open to making hindi content, but struggling with having both languages under one channel v/s having separate channel. Tough choice !! Although Ashish who had done an AMA asked me clearly to pick one language if i cant sustain 2 channels.
[20/11/18, 11:35:53 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): On the same topic, Nowadays I see big players on YT i.e Set India started writing video title in Hindi. So I think clearly there is edge
[20/11/18, 11:36:49 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Yes that is an edge.
Having subtitles,but not sure if it will aesthetically look good
[20/11/18, 11:37:46 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Hindi content is here to stay for a long time.
You can reach to the tier 3 cities towns and villages too.
[20/11/18, 11:38:01 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): did he mean subtitles?
[20/11/18, 11:38:23 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): I think so
[20/11/18, 11:38:37 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): I responded thinking it to be subtitles 😄
[20/11/18, 11:43:20 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Bhavi u hit the nail ...
‎[20/11/18, 11:46:51 PM] Vineet (pushstart): ‎Contact card omitted
[20/11/18, 11:47:16 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): Nirav, here is the link to my channel if you'd like to glance through. Its called Joygeeks, and i create beauty & wellness content.  http://www.youtube.com/c/JoyGeeks  I'd love to know your POV on how to handle english & hindi language pls.
[20/11/18, 11:48:18 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Aparna why to make another channel for Hindi..u can create same video and add to same channel..just keep Hindi title with min keyword..which will help subscribers to reach to your channel..

Nowadays many Hindi speaking subscribers e.g. OLA Uber Cab driver they do search in Hindi only on YouTube..instead on Google ..

Hence we have big opportunities for enter in those city .

I remember I went to Surat 3 months ago ..my cousin who is app developer show me gujrati video of local guy who create videos on cooking and lifestyle... now he is influencer on that local crowds ...Hence I told to make videos in regional language ...
[20/11/18, 11:48:19 PM] Vineet (pushstart): Speak to my friend giving my reference Vineet from Grassroot Live.. He will help you out.. He launched Budweiser in Orissa.
[20/11/18, 11:49:21 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): What are the ways to reach these local nano influencers?
[20/11/18, 11:49:51 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): That's great, so same video in hindi.
We record at the same time right.
Just that we need to edit 2 videos instead of one
[20/11/18, 11:50:35 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Your videos are great, have subscribed to your channel 👍
[20/11/18, 11:51:02 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): but then isnt it putting off to have to filter through same content in both languages for both english & hindi viewers?
[20/11/18, 11:51:36 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Contact on their channel u will get the email and contact detail ..

Once I start blog on entrepreneurs..I call you big influencer on YouTube ...they denied me for their interview saying that your list is too small and we are big YouTube channel hence can't help u ..

In case of small influencer they get ready to work with u.
[20/11/18, 11:52:08 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): Thank you Dr. Mody, thats really sweet of you 🙏🏼😀
[20/11/18, 11:52:50 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Exactly. I am in that phase where I am looking to collaborate with a lot of such nano-influencers.
[20/11/18, 11:53:07 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): Hmm,not really sure. I too am little confused
[20/11/18, 11:53:19 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): 😊🤗
[20/11/18, 11:53:33 PM] Bhavi Mody (ps): For?
[20/11/18, 11:54:58 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): How about dubbing the same video to other lang?
[20/11/18, 11:55:10 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): i can easily dub my current content into hindi as well, but having 2 videos in different language  but same content under the same channel?? my current solution to this problem seems to be to shoot in english and add hindi subtitles.
[20/11/18, 11:55:27 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Aparna saw your one video on Canada Face Ultima...gr8 content voice clarity ...r u using dlsr or smart phone for recording...
[20/11/18, 11:55:48 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): That is also good ideas

So anyone who is interested can have a look (www.presolv360.com) and feel free to download them!

[24/11/18, 7:17:48 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!

Agenda was to make Top Entrepreneurs from Pune MEET so that they can GROW their Business and Referral Network.

It was so AMAZING to see Entrepreneurs from Pune working on crazy stuff ranging from securing Visitor Entry to Selling flowers online and minting 1Cr+ annually.

45+ CURATED PushCEOs attended the PushConnect and shared about their Startup Journey which was accompanied by Networking over Snacks and Chai! 

Ishan Talathi #PushLaunched CloudJiffy, a Cloud-based Container as a service which promises to reduce your cloud costs up to 80% with Zero capacity planning and automated DevOps.

[01/12/18, 6:21:00 AM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Hi all, 

I have been in this group for a few months but have never formally introduced myself. Here's a bit about me :

I am a licensed attorney advising startups, SMEs and business focused individuals in legal management, strategy and execution. I work both as outside counsel as well as strategist / manager for in – house legal teams.

My forte is business and commercial law. I focus on applying the law for risk mitigation and prevention, and ensuring laws, policies and procedures are implemented to align with the overall business goals. I advise on setting up and structuring business, drafting contracts which are simple yet exhaustive with the goal of building smooth relationships, building and managing IP portfolios to add to overall net worth and credibility of businesses, and negotiating and settling disputes.

I also act as strategic consultant for several law firms based in Mumbai and Delhi and helping them enter new markets and improving client relationships. I have edited several legal commentaries and books in the past, and continue to remain involved in academia. 

Look forward to meeting with you all today. 

 *; TLDR :* Attorney with Commercial Law focus. Also involved in the legal tech, management consulting for professional services, and academia.

Compliments,

Namit Oberoy

VStEP, a Viacom18 initiative for the startup community, is inviting startups to co-innovate and offer solutions for challenges being faced by the media industry today.


Currently open for applications, VStEP 2.0 will introduce participation from angel investors, industry experts and the VC community. 11 Problem Statements and 7 Focus Areas across various functions have been identified and outlined for startups to present solutions. While the ‘Focus Areas’ are broader aspects where the program seeks new suggestions and innovations from the startup ecosystem, the ‘Problem Statements’ are immediate and pertain to specific requirements of the businesses and are best solved through focused solutions.

The applications are open now.

[04/12/18, 11:05:56 AM] Amrik (pushstart): 😁 very helpful. I am sure there is some standardisation
[04/12/18, 11:06:42 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): there is none when it comes to internship, internship is a way of companies training and working with student community, they often pay what they feel is worth it or dont pay

[04/12/18, 11:07:58 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): plus changes domain to domain
[04/12/18, 11:08:59 AM] Amrik (pushstart): This could be relevant
[04/12/18, 11:09:18 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): some domains like media, IT, PR have really low payout ( mostly 0 ) towards interns, same with startups as well as founders/managers have to spend a lot of time training and teaching the interns

There is one ayurveda charya in junagagh who is 90 plus old and spend entire life in ayurveda ..He has sure shot remedy in cancer ..He treat according to traditional ayurveda ..although don't have a degree but the knowledge and experience is vast than modern medicine doctors ..
[07/12/18, 2:54:59 PM] Rab Khan (ps): Yeah, doctor said we can't do chemo and radiation, only palliative treatment. 

We are trying everything. I am taking her at Hinduja, heard they are good. And my family is talking to Manoj sonawne we heard he helped lots of patients.

[07/12/18, 3:06:49 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): My preference would be ayurveda since modern allopathic treat  won't help that much ..also Ayurveda says ..Cancer is create out of *Kaffa* hence the practitioner suggest to stop all intake of milk and product made out of milk and sugar ..what to says further we have ayurveda doc arjun in our pushstart ..He can give better advise on this ..🙏

# We'll provide the news story, text, links, & other details neatly dissected.

# The task is to make the script & the video (using open source videos/images, graphics, background sound, etc). We are interested in two styles:

👉A narration based video. Something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygEY3GzoxE or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mDsa-AqNcQ.

👉A video with a news reader. (One of us at UnFound can act as a news reader). Production quality like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN7hKU5m_20.

[13/12/18, 5:03:11 PM] Arjun (pushstart): Yup this is true for prescription medicines - I read it too!
[13/12/18, 5:10:14 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Hey Ankur, just went through the references. I would suggest to keep an in-house video editor for such works. These are something which usually no creative professional shows in his portfolio. So we make sure we charge a surplus while creating these kind of videos. The in-house guy might not have a great taste as a good and experienced freelancer/ agency but will slowly catch up. Also since you guys will be properly guiding with the script and storyline, it makes sense to avoid the long distance iteration and revision loops and rather have it done in-house quickly.
[13/12/18, 5:11:31 PM] Ankur Pandey (ps): Hmm. We can explore that option too. Do you have any referrals?
[13/12/18, 5:18:26 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): any freelancer who is into online media planning and buying?

[14/12/18, 12:10:10 AM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Lawyers are generally expensive resources.

Could someone get me in touch with a few communities/groups in Kolkata for an event I'm organizing -- for a collaboration to get registrations? 

Brief of the event attached below. 

Thanks a ton. 😇
[16/12/18, 12:38:41 PM] Atijya (Pushstart): People of Kolkata. We're organizing our first version of Safe Space Initiative : Chapter 1 in Kolkata.

Date 📅 : 7th January, 2019

Time 🕧 : 3-7 pm. 

*WHAT'S THE EVENT ABOUT?*

👣 Safe space where people gather together and share what they're going through in an intimate, vulnerable setting.

👣 Ten minutes to speak their hearts out. 

👣 No advice. No feedback. No judgment. 

*WHO SHOULD ATTEND THE EVENT?*

 👍 Those who're tired of the endless pretense.

👍 Students, working professionals, the young, the old.

👍 Those who are sick of putting the best version of themselves online for the world to see and judge. 

👍 Those who have people around them but no real friends to share what they're going through. 

👍 Who don't want to be judged, told what to do, or shut down. 

👍 Those who're just tired of the endless stigma and judgment. 

👍 Those who want to just observe and revel in vulnerable and heartfelt conversations. 

We'll be ending with a reflection session in the end, quick food🍕🍲 and beverages 🍹☕ in between, and a warm and mighty hug before we part ways. 💕

The event is open to 25 people.

Normal registrations -- 300 rupees. 

Student registrations -- 200 rupees. 

To know more check out the event @ https://bit.ly/2QWY9OW

[20/12/18, 10:21:02 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Generally a good idea to plan for 6 months at a time. And batch content. That gives you time to work on your business the rest of the time.

[24/12/18, 7:15:52 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): This sounds awesome and would save so much of time, however one can lose out on being current if prerecorded extensively rgt.
[24/12/18, 7:28:56 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): That's true Aparna but these guys shoot current when it's required. Otherwise they use the scheduled content. It saves a ton of time and money.
[24/12/18, 7:32:24 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I agree. You can plan and create 80% of the content, and let the other 20% be more current/trendy/situational. But having the 80% made well in advance allows for room for fuck ups. And if there is one thing I have learnt is to allow for room for fucks ups coz they always come haha
[24/12/18, 7:33:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes most of the active content creators do this
[24/12/18, 7:33:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Be it text, video or audio
[24/12/18, 7:41:12 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): It would be so awesome if I could do that. What field are you talking about though pls. I find that in beauty since there are soooo many new launches that we do not really have a clue about till they launch actually , maybe 50% can be pre recorded. But wellness surely I can pre record tons and I have already started that. So thankful for this topic to have surfaced 🙌
[24/12/18, 7:45:57 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): You are the expert so I can't say, but maybe generic content like '10 beauty lessons from deepika'. So you can use her past stuff, maybe add a point here and there if she did something latest. Just a suggestion I dunno if this works in beauty content.
[24/12/18, 7:52:16 PM] Shabia Walia (ps): Ya or out of 4 in a month, 2 can be pre-recorded as all time relevant and 2 can be current.
[24/12/18, 7:53:50 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Have tie-ups so that you get stuff prior to launch so that you can pre-record ;)
‎[24/12/18, 7:56:09 PM] A C Biyani (pushstart): ‎image omitted
[24/12/18, 8:23:54 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): There are quite a few fields that do this. For launches you'll have to film current. But other generic stuff, frequently asked Qs or Q and As are also batched. Mindset things on beauty is also a part of it. Only thing is you'll have to plan and it'll give you an opportunity to reach out to brands to tell them you are scheduling the shoot if they wanna get on board earlier.
[24/12/18, 8:24:42 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Yup good one

[26/12/18, 11:52:44 AM] Rushabh (ps): Hey Fellow Entrepreneurs,
It's time to take a step back and THINK!

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

Register Now to Avail!

[30/12/18, 12:27:01 PM] Raunak Jhaveri (ps): Hey guys! To briefly introduce myself my name is Raunak Jhaveri. I’m 23 years old 

I completed my IB Diploma at BD Somani and did my undergraduate degree in Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, USA)  with a minor in Innovation, Economics and Entrepreneurship. I recently completed the ‘Start Your Business’ program at SPJIMR

Shortly after I worked at McKinsey & Co as a Business Analyst. I worked on projects in various industries including healthcare, chemicals,  insurance, etc. 

I returned to India a few months back and am looking to create a start-up 

Where I can help: my family is involved in diamond trading, jewellery retails (Goldsmiths, Hughes road), hospitality (Treasure Island Resort, Lonavala) and fashion (Fuel the fashion store). 
I can also leverage networks from McKinsey USA, Carnegie Mellon, SPJIMR and Alpha Kappa Psi (pan USA business organization) 
Personally I enjoy solving business problems and my experience has helped give structure and guidance in doing the same. 

I am happy to help with anything related to the above and more if possible. Please don’t hesitate to ask! 

I am super excited to be a part of this group and I hope I get the chance to meet and work with y’all! 

Happy holidays and good luck to all my fellow entrepreneurs!

Great speaking to you, mansi. I rest my case here. Don't wanna troll the group. Sorry @918779219493.
[31/12/18, 10:56:24 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Parameters/metrices for assessment of usefulness ? Although I agree with you.

[31/12/18, 1:41:20 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Ninja delete was needed
[31/12/18, 1:42:55 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Axis ka factoring has really worked well for us. 

Will need to have more details for more comments.
[31/12/18, 1:45:48 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): I have a substantial amount pending from a client on the basis of 6-7 invoices. Before issuing a legal notice I want to see if an agency can irritate the hell out of them by greeting them with a recovery call in the morning / evening everyday. I got this idea from the way bank's use their collection departments, they don't care about anything and will call you incessantly.
[31/12/18, 1:48:18 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Doesn't work without threat of legal
[31/12/18, 1:49:36 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): I am more than happy to jump on legal.
[31/12/18, 1:49:57 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Works best in my case
[31/12/18, 1:50:17 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): But I don't think that's preferable cause there's a huge strategic difference between irritating someone psychologically to force voluntary payments, and actually going legal
[31/12/18, 1:50:20 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): 1 legal notice, 1 call from policy station gets the ball rolling
[31/12/18, 1:51:01 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): People who don't want to pay will ignore and not bend by irritation
[31/12/18, 1:51:10 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): I am a lawyer so I can source my legal work in house. But from experience that this is as much a psychological area.
[31/12/18, 1:51:31 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Go to the local police station. Give the thulla some money and ask him to Call and threaten this guy
[31/12/18, 1:51:37 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Lawyer way would take a bit longer
[31/12/18, 1:51:55 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): If you already have a connect in that police station, works the best
[31/12/18, 1:52:05 PM] Bharat Acharya (pushstart): The other guy (if powerful) can screw you badly
[31/12/18, 1:52:21 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): This is why I said this
[31/12/18, 1:52:49 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Umm guys I do this work professionally. But that's not what I prefer to jump on. I am a lawyer and my client is also a law firm. I don't think legal is a smart idea cause here both parties are highly litigious.
[31/12/18, 1:53:27 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Aaah makes sense now, threat won't work and filing a case is pointless in India
[31/12/18, 1:53:33 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Business is all about relationships and manytimes one should first figure out the intent before trying alternative means of recovery

1. Is the person wanting to pay but goijg through tough times and hence cannot pay

Or

2. He doesnt want to pay

More often constant followup dialogue etc does the trick...
[31/12/18, 1:53:37 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Legal is not a smart idea as the default option*
[31/12/18, 1:53:46 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): It can be dragged on for years
[31/12/18, 1:54:33 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): We go through many such incidences especially since we work with hotels and resorts ..... its a bad idea to put relationships at stake for money
[31/12/18, 1:55:04 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Choose my first *deleted* suggestion then
[31/12/18, 1:55:32 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Namit, Appreciate your professionalism and ethical code of conduct. 🙏🏻

Banks factoring process would definitely work well. Legal process will not help in a quick settlement for reasons known best to you.
[31/12/18, 1:55:41 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Its number 2. chief. I agree. For last two months, more unconventional ways have been working for me in collecting debt. A smile to my face, having a coffee and willingness to negotiate has been working wonders.
[31/12/18, 1:56:01 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Thanks I tend to agree.
[31/12/18, 1:56:33 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Do you have any connects?
[31/12/18, 1:56:37 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): If its 2 figure out why he doesn't want to pay..find out common social connects..use them effectively and
[31/12/18, 2:03:06 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I do. But I'm a defaulter myself😂😂.

My refernce would add more damage to the same.
[31/12/18, 2:04:07 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): @919619048151   see this and try for those clients!
[31/12/18, 2:04:41 PM] Zareen (pushstart): @918953881643 noted.
[31/12/18, 2:05:13 PM] Devang Raja (Venturewolf): They are professional cheaters. Legal notice and phone calls don't make too much of difference to them.
[31/12/18, 2:05:57 PM] Devang Raja (Venturewolf): After all the defaulter will tell you to do whatever you can the legal way. And you'll go mad doing it the legal way.
[31/12/18, 2:05:59 PM] Dimple (ps): I have had such clients too. My way of dealing with them is I go in their office uninformed and sit there ,raise my volume a little and tell them I am not going without taking my money.
[31/12/18, 2:06:34 PM] Devang Raja (Venturewolf): Works for women.. Not for men.. 😝 😝
[31/12/18, 2:07:32 PM] Dimple (ps): I've have had clients. Who say they are mentally unwell. Going through depression. But when you see their facebook they are roaming here and there .where does the ticket money come from?  And how are they even able to run companies. Niyat honi chaiye deneki
[31/12/18, 2:08:06 PM] Dimple (ps): Post one bad experience I completely stop it. As recruitment  work happens on credit only.
[31/12/18, 2:08:40 PM] Dimple (ps): Nothing to do with gender. Honestly
[31/12/18, 2:09:46 PM] Dimple (ps): Also ek baar legal notice do toh woh haath upar b kar sakta hai ki nai hai.. Nai de sakta
[31/12/18, 2:10:28 PM] Dimple (ps): So I suggest you to go at his office uninformed and talk!!  Don't abuse. Just talk normally and try and get payment. Or send someone on your behalf
[31/12/18, 2:14:38 PM] Dimple (ps): There are no relationships in business first thing. Ain't no one doing favors when there is invoice. And what's there to keep with unprofessional ppl?  And what relationship?  If they valued they would pay right?
[31/12/18, 2:15:47 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Thats what dimpleji ... if niyat nahi hai to social connect se u can recover dues
[31/12/18, 2:17:02 PM] Dimple (ps): Elaborate more on using social connects?  You mean mutual connections
[31/12/18, 2:21:43 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): The banks could not recover so I issued a loan on working capital.

Unless they recover from that person, I would also not pay them.
[31/12/18, 2:22:04 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Sahi hai
[31/12/18, 2:22:56 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Disagree. 

Damage of time, energy and repute. This is more valuable than money.
[31/12/18, 2:23:05 PM] Dimple (ps): Sahi nahi hai. :)
[31/12/18, 2:23:23 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Yes... u can figure out who clients client's are and smartly put pressure
[31/12/18, 2:23:36 PM] Dimple (ps): Okay. Noted :)
[31/12/18, 2:23:55 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Okay. I won't argue. 😜
[31/12/18, 2:25:05 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Just by having cofee with clientd circle in presence of client without touching the subject of money will ensure recovery...
[31/12/18, 2:25:42 PM] Dimple (ps): What if the client purposely ignores, messages, calls and there are no social connects
[31/12/18, 2:25:46 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Other option is to break up the payment  value into smaller chunks..but that works if client wants to pay
[31/12/18, 2:25:59 PM] Dimple (ps): I mean ignores calls, messages etc completely
[31/12/18, 2:26:53 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): In our case we deal with hotels and into product supply.. so for us relationships is the only way..cause if we stop supply money will never ever be recoverdd
[31/12/18, 2:26:58 PM] Dimple (ps): Right. But depends on the kind of client also. If there is a money crunch this happens. But if not some purposely delay too so that you get tired of asking and leave it finally
[31/12/18, 2:27:24 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Did u meet client and speak 121 and tell him your issues...
[31/12/18, 2:27:27 PM] Dimple (ps): Hmmm
[31/12/18, 2:28:21 PM] Dimple (ps): Yes.  He is capable to eat your time and be in complete denial mode of your needs because to him if others are delaying his payment and he can handle it. He thinks others should also handle it.
[31/12/18, 2:28:42 PM] Dimple (ps): That's purposely delaying btw
[31/12/18, 2:28:58 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): There's a popular saying in marwadi - 

" Jeno kaam teno kare, dujo kare gota khaave". which means that there are specialized agencies to get rid of this. 

Message to all my hustling friends - "know what you are at best and delegate the rest".
[31/12/18, 2:29:15 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Find out who his clients are......find ur friend or relative in thst company
[31/12/18, 2:30:27 PM] Ayush Goyal (ps): If it's not a disputed payment then take this via insolvency, no matter how litigious they are. I have few IB experts on our marketplace who will help you recover payment without any call, threat etc within 60-90 days and that too with atleast 18% interest
[31/12/18, 2:31:12 PM] Ayush Goyal (ps): But i guess you are actively looking forward to torture the shit out of the party instead of money that's why you need  a recovery agency 😁
[31/12/18, 2:31:51 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): It is not for us as reputed entrepreneurs seeking to make a dent or revolutionizing traditional business to go and yell or shout, use abusive language. 

We must ensure to be diplomatically correct to maintain a prosperous venture. That's my take and personal opinion. 

Note : Please note the above opinion belongs to a 25 year old hustler just one amongst you. Viewers are requested to consider his age before judging his remarks.
[31/12/18, 2:32:27 PM] Dimple (ps): I never meant abuse. It's obviously bad. :)
[31/12/18, 2:35:40 PM] shashank (pushstart): I just file MSME case that's it 
Samaadhan is the most powerful tool I have ever used.

[31/12/18, 3:57:05 PM] Devang Raja (Venturewolf): These would already be back dates invoices. How do we discount back dated invoices?
[31/12/18, 4:46:34 PM] ‪+91 81081 04481‬: The discount (factoring) will be based on age of the invoice, amount and quality of party involved
[31/12/18, 4:47:25 PM] Devang Raja (Venturewolf): Interesting.. Have you done any back dated discounting so far?
[31/12/18, 4:47:58 PM] ‪+91 81081 04481‬: Yes but not in India

[07/01/19, 5:38:44 PM] Ajit K Jain (ps): Udyog Aadhar is nothing but a government registration that is provided along with a recognition certificate and a unique number in order to certify small/medium businesses or enterprises.

 Check out top 10 benefits

 derived from the numerous schemes that are offered by the Ministry of MSME with the aim to protect small enterprises and to assist them in growth and development.

Excise exemption The exemption under the direct tax laws Reduction in fee for filing patents and trademarks
Credit guarantee scheme
After getting registered with MSME, your business will get eligible for availing government scheme benefits which will include loans without guarantee, low-interest rates on loan, and easy loan. You will have financial backing from the government for participating in foreign business expos.

You will also get to enjoy other forms of subsidies that will help you in increasing your company’s revenue. Great concession in electricity bills. You will get an exemption when your enterprise applies for government tenders.

 Almost every type of business entity can obtain Udyog Aadhar, be it Hindu Undivided Family, Proprietorship, one-person company, Partnership Firm, production company, limited company, private limited company, limited liability partnership, co-operative societies or any association of persons or any other undertaking.

But you should know that there are a set of criteria that an entity has to meet in order to be classified as a medium, small or micro enterprise for obtaining the MSME registration.

If you own a company or an enterprise, then you should check if your entity can be classified as a medium, small or micro industry under the criteria defined in the MSMED Act, 2006 for checking your eligibility.

The owner, director or proprietor of the entity will provide his/her 12-digit Aadhar Number, whether the enterprise or entity is a sole proprietor, an LLP, a Private limited company or anything else. It should have the recognition certificate provided via the MSME registration process.

Thanks for adding me here Neeraj! 😊

I am Anshul, Sr. Community Manager at 91springboard Lotus hub. I have been a part of 91springboard journey from last 2.5 years and many more to go. I think some of you have already met me at different events.

Before this, I have pursued my B.Com(H) from Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University and always had interest in upcoming innovations and social projects. 91springboard provided me this platform where I can be amongst you all (as personally I don't think I have the courage to run a startup 😛, hats off to everyone here with wonderful ideas)
Feel free to reach out to me for any help you need with regards to startup knowledge or connections. 

P. S. For people who are still thinking Anshul can only be a boy, I am a girl 😬😅

Drones are never going to be practical solutions in urban India...

1. We can't even run double decker buses in cities bcoz of electricity lines.... How are drones going to deliver in residential areas which are congested n have no right infrastructure?

2. We have very high urban crime rate n growing unemployment will be only increase the rate further... We can't be assured of vehicles parked on roads to be safe... How is company going to ensure safety and retrieval of the Drones?

3. Who will handle any disputes or accidents?

4. What will be the cost of delivery? How about unemployment and social cost? 

5. How profitable it is?

[17/01/19, 10:32:58 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Hello Riddhi,

You have lot many places to find a co-founder. But the journey only starts If you've identified the invisible cofounders.
[17/01/19, 10:33:59 PM] Riddhi Doshi (ps): Certainly
[17/01/19, 10:40:05 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): That was an issue with GST. 

But then as far as I can recall, they also special drives in the month of feb and may 2018 to refund gst to exporters. 

These custom houses also have a dedicated cell and If you don't get lucky there, seek an officer intervention stating that there is a mismatch in invoice details shipping bills and GST return cases. 

Hope this helps !
[17/01/19, 10:41:19 PM] Riddhi Doshi (ps): 😊aah... Still a newbie
[17/01/19, 10:51:37 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Disagree. 

You must read a study published by Dan wang entitled "The economics of drone delivery". Pretty much answers all your questions. Employment toh increase karega. 

What's untapped in that article was:
1. Milk run(no. of stops from point A to B) and and the drop size(volume) at each stop.
[17/01/19, 10:53:52 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Drones actually might be good idea given our cities are very crowded, specially the low cost living areas.
[17/01/19, 10:55:05 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): And can even make sense for easy access to very remote areas, though I am not sure it makes economic sense because the range of these drones isn't very high.
[17/01/19, 10:55:39 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Rural areas would be the market
[17/01/19, 10:55:48 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Tier 3/2 cities
[17/01/19, 10:57:36 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): But i can imagine people trying to steal them and sell its parts. Which makes economic sense for them.
[17/01/19, 11:03:48 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Nahi geography is not a constraint per se. Geography and its economics is well justified in that study. 

1. What bothers me is the the number of drop points on a delivery route ? And what would be the volume of those drop offs ? 

2. Drone jugadu element kaha se laayega ? Finding the shortest distance ? Last minute decisions.
[17/01/19, 11:16:11 PM] Nithya Prabu (pushstart): Dear all, please, may I know if there are any special educational needs specialist amongst us? I would like to know some details about SEN provisions in Indian schools and if there are any colleges offering degree programmes for children who need special attention in their learning process. Thank you.

[19/01/19, 5:34:46 PM] Namit Oberoy (ps): Hello good people. 

After the very recent data breach of reportedly 700 emails and passwords, I checked to see if any services which help you see if your own data has been compromised, and found that my primary email address _was_ one of those accounts.

This scared the shit out of me because for literally every single service on the web which has "sign in with google", I have used this account, and also this email probably has the most amount of personal, sensitive and confidential data that's possibly available in the digital world on me. 

With this context, I have two questions:

1. Is there any way knowing for sure how protected my account is? I am now very skeptical and unsure which service to trust. 

2. What are some measures you guys have in place to protect your data?

Customers may pay on the website, or through links passed on Whatsapp etc. Up to 1000 such transactions per month. 
Money to be collected on a monthly/quarterly basis
[20/01/19, 2:10:14 PM] shashank (pushstart): Razorpay! 
Instamojo is costly and failures are high.
[20/01/19, 2:10:22 PM] shashank (pushstart): You can do wonders with instamojo
[20/01/19, 2:12:08 PM] Hitesh Mehta (pushstart): RazorPay is good.. 

Signed up two accounts with them recently for my clients.. also signing up for my project soon
[20/01/19, 2:14:16 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Will recommend cashfree as they have many other options, like pay later etc.
You can check mine - pay.digitalcube.tech 
I have integrated 2 payment gateways
[20/01/19, 3:35:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Can connect with Razorpay if u want
[20/01/19, 3:56:10 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Would want to connect with people who have worked or are working with MPos solution and markets. 

Looking to connect with professionals in the domains of customer acquisition,Ad sales, hardware sales and training.

Looking to disscuss innovative hardware in the POS market. And general industry dip stick.

Does anybody here knows a guy who might know a guy who deals in f&b distribution specifically in South India. 
Please dm me.

Thank you 

Cheers,

[20/01/19, 5:06:31 PM] Manmohan Gupta (ps): Use Paytm, faster reimbursement.
Instamojo expensive and poor customer support.

If you need Paytm connect, inform me
[20/01/19, 5:08:37 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Agree ...insta customer care is worst but their features and usage is best ...
[20/01/19, 5:08:54 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Anyone expert in 
Neuro marketing here? Kindly
Dm.
Needed ur help
[20/01/19, 5:11:38 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Talk to Arbab
[20/01/19, 5:11:56 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Apart from him?
[20/01/19, 5:13:04 PM] Manmohan Gupta (ps): Paytm features are too good, next day reimbursement, lower cost and you can enjoy SMS invoice with lowest downtime connectivity
[20/01/19, 5:14:19 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): @919082972051
[20/01/19, 5:16:01 PM] Manmohan Gupta (ps): You also can use Cashfree with all wallets and payment gateway at one place. This is PayPal company
[20/01/19, 5:16:58 PM] Tejal (ps): 👍🏼 done
[20/01/19, 5:18:32 PM] Tejal (ps): For subscription, not acquisition  :)
[20/01/19, 5:19:46 PM] Tejal (ps): Razorpay worked.
[20/01/19, 5:20:43 PM] Richa Sethi (ps): We also use razorpay
[20/01/19, 5:23:43 PM] Tejal (ps): 💪🏻
[20/01/19, 5:24:55 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): That is incubated and funded by PayPal but not PayPal company 😊

[22/01/19, 12:38:24 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Innov8 gets acquired by oyo?
[22/01/19, 12:38:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 😳
[22/01/19, 12:40:40 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Ask ritesh ?
[22/01/19, 12:40:53 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha
[22/01/19, 12:41:17 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I am serious, this is a shit move
[22/01/19, 12:41:20 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Kab hua ye?
[22/01/19, 12:41:36 AM] ‪+91 89803 80828‬: https://entrackr.com/2019/01/oyo-acquire-innov8/
[22/01/19, 12:41:55 AM] Neeraj Joshi: WhyV
[22/01/19, 12:43:48 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Cos Oyo will now carpet bomb, slash prices and pull down the whole of industry
[22/01/19, 12:44:16 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): With too much money in pockets, Wework would have done that already
[22/01/19, 12:44:36 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): OYO wants to expand its Full stack product in Real estate
[22/01/19, 12:44:41 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): I would say a good move
[22/01/19, 12:44:56 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Wework are not in the same space, it's more about premium community space rather that affordable workspace
[22/01/19, 12:45:19 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Not the same market bro
[22/01/19, 12:45:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: They don’t serve to the same market
[22/01/19, 12:45:50 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Good point
[22/01/19, 12:46:11 AM] Neeraj Joshi: But even Innov8 wasn’t in that affordable coworking sector. Was it?
[22/01/19, 12:46:24 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): It was the upper end of it
[22/01/19, 12:46:55 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Yes!
[22/01/19, 12:47:19 AM] Neeraj Joshi: It was more on the premium side, Atleast premiumeer than 91 and others
[22/01/19, 12:47:23 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Agreed. But they had the money, How difficult is venturing in the same market? Capturing that as well?
[22/01/19, 12:47:36 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Everything is more premium than 91sp
[22/01/19, 12:48:07 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Kya bol rahe ho bhai? 🙄
[22/01/19, 12:48:20 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Why would wework dilute its brand?
[22/01/19, 12:48:23 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Kuch bhi
[22/01/19, 12:48:35 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): They are not interested in that, Wework is like country club for startups
[22/01/19, 12:49:12 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): It's not a replacement of traditional office space
[22/01/19, 12:49:22 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): But a upgradation infact
[22/01/19, 12:49:43 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): But now ritesh can happily declare himself an investor
[22/01/19, 12:57:39 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): Chalo congratulations SoftBank 😂😜
[22/01/19, 12:58:54 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[22/01/19, 12:59:05 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Why would it not?
[22/01/19, 12:59:33 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Many Brands have come up with a different brand for a different market segment!
[22/01/19, 12:59:52 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Acquire the market entirely, create that Monopoly
[22/01/19, 12:59:56 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Name a few?
[22/01/19, 1:00:24 AM] Neeraj Joshi: The market that wework is big enough for them to look for other markets bro
[22/01/19, 1:00:46 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): No market is never too big
[22/01/19, 1:00:58 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Ye batayo
[22/01/19, 1:00:58 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Why is Reliance getting into E-commerce?
[22/01/19, 1:01:42 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): One plus and Vivo, oppo
[22/01/19, 1:01:57 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): All of them owned by BBK electronics
[22/01/19, 1:02:44 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): One Plus is a high end phone. Market leader, why oppo and Vivo? Now a sub brand Realme which is in the 5-8k segment too
[22/01/19, 1:02:45 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Why?
[22/01/19, 1:03:09 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Not all brands have the Same motive
[22/01/19, 1:03:16 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): And they are different brands FYI
[22/01/19, 1:03:33 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): They are the same company
[22/01/19, 1:03:44 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Different brands for different market segmenr
[22/01/19, 1:03:47 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): That's all
[22/01/19, 1:03:48 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Different brand, different positioning
[22/01/19, 1:04:01 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Same company..:) Same owner?
[22/01/19, 1:04:12 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): To capture the entire market!
[22/01/19, 1:04:13 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): That's a different thing
[22/01/19, 1:04:33 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Not every brand wants that
[22/01/19, 1:04:46 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): We would never know this
[22/01/19, 1:04:57 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Unless we are the founders..:)
[22/01/19, 1:05:16 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Well this is going too hypothetical even for me
[22/01/19, 1:06:38 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Peter Thiel puts it very well, the aim for all wildly successful startups is always to become a monopoly. Warren Buffet also says the same, to build moats.
[22/01/19, 1:06:59 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Love you Buddy!
[22/01/19, 1:07:01 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): 😃
[22/01/19, 1:07:12 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Wanted to quote him from Zero to One..:)
[22/01/19, 1:07:16 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): 😉
[22/01/19, 1:07:22 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Yes, exactly!
[22/01/19, 1:07:55 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): @919937536453  touche 

If we consider singularity as a whole and the big theme of millennials not owning realestate/assets...Oyo/we work/Ola and the likes are all.

Assets are cheap and rent is paid.
[22/01/19, 1:08:28 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Singularity? 🤔
[22/01/19, 1:09:29 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): https://youtu.be/jIEfPlvnLFw
[22/01/19, 1:09:34 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): singularity is the hypothesis that the invention of artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization
[22/01/19, 1:09:38 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): https://youtu.be/jIEfPlvnLFw
[22/01/19, 1:11:33 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): You might as well qoute Adam Smith on Monopoly over Peter Thiel
[22/01/19, 1:12:22 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): For those wondering who Adam Smith is, please Google
[22/01/19, 1:14:09 AM] Ishan Talathi (ps): Does the common end user know this? They think OPPO, vivo, OnePlus are competitors, they compare their flagship phones with each other and finally end up buying one of 3. Say there are 5 flagships in the same price, 60% chance that they will buy from BBK, compared to a 20% chance. Plus component sharing, R&D etc saves a ton of costs for them
[22/01/19, 1:14:35 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): That's a smart move by the company
[22/01/19, 1:15:06 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): They are not monopolising brand and market wise but making a killer in sales
[22/01/19, 1:16:24 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Adam Smith is 🙌🏼
[22/01/19, 1:17:07 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): That's what most CPGs do "consumer product group" companies work. Brands are answers to logical fallacies. 

It's similar to how WPP or the BIG 6 communication groups work
[22/01/19, 1:18:47 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): They cater to a wider market which gives them higher chance of success in a free market
[22/01/19, 1:19:09 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Incidentally I wrote about Zero to One, Monopolies and building moats yesterday, if anyone is interested :)  https://link.medium.com/deCefJanFT
[22/01/19, 1:19:33 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Smooth plug 😉
[22/01/19, 1:19:49 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Also keeps the brand image seperate. The same reason Ferrari won't make a cheap Ferrari branded car.
[22/01/19, 1:20:00 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Do you think Monopoly can exist in a free market ?
[22/01/19, 1:21:47 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Sustained monopolies are rare imo, and as the model or innovation is adopted by competitors the monopoly advantage goes out with time. I read an interesting article on this, let me find it.

[22/01/19, 1:25:02 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Aaah yes
[22/01/19, 1:25:51 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Hence the more innovative you are the longer you get to sustain in the the market
[22/01/19, 1:27:52 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Schumpeter was very much on point with his thoughts
[22/01/19, 1:28:08 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I agree
[22/01/19, 1:29:44 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): But then does this apply to startups working just the valuation game ?
[22/01/19, 1:31:43 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Cos there they pump up value in promise of future profits
[22/01/19, 1:32:08 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Hmm i think it does. It can be the first mover advantage, or brand, or some proprietary technology, or network effect. Something which the startup has that gives them an unfair advantage
[22/01/19, 1:32:50 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): And they over time die out with competition figuring the game out in a better way
[22/01/19, 1:32:55 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Is it ?
[22/01/19, 2:10:59 AM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): I think so, or you keep up the lead
[22/01/19, 2:12:26 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I am more gonna research on this area
[22/01/19, 10:49:46 AM] Anshul Bansal (91andheri): Hey anyone who can help with any reference for setting up a photo booth for republic day celebrations? Budget is less than 5k

There is a lot of confusion around whether to add your friends to FB and then here or the other way around. 

In the past 2 weeks, a lot of pushstarters have reached out to me asking *how to add people in their network to this community?*

It’s pretty simple, just share this form with the interested folks in your network, we will add them here directly after going through their profile once 😋😋

Sounds good? 

Then start sharing this registration form with fellow founders in your network:
http://bit.ly/Pushstartform

Cheers!
[22/01/19, 1:06:04 PM] Sunny (workbay): Hi Pushstarters. A very good afternoon to all of you. Just had a quick question. Do we have a work men's hostel anywhere in the western suburbs which includes meals facility.

[22/01/19, 2:32:02 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Aanchal. Before I answer this, can you tell me where all will this be displayed and who is your target.
[22/01/19, 2:34:31 PM] Aanchal (ps): Salons are the targets
[22/01/19, 2:34:41 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Just because something looks good doesn't necessarily mean it will sell well. Read the million dollar loss Tropicana faced because of packaging change. Always design for your target.
[22/01/19, 2:35:09 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Where do they normally purchase from ? Online or offline?
[22/01/19, 2:35:15 PM] Aanchal (ps): It’s a professional wax brand so we don’t retail it
[22/01/19, 2:35:35 PM] Vikas Shah (nodd): Send the CV to me
[22/01/19, 2:36:06 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): This

[22/01/19, 2:36:26 PM] Aanchal (ps): Thank you Ahaan
[22/01/19, 2:36:56 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): 😎
[22/01/19, 2:37:11 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Ok so you are designing for women who work in the salons.
[22/01/19, 2:37:27 PM] Aanchal (ps): Yes
[22/01/19, 2:37:43 PM] Aanchal (ps): And Salon owners
[22/01/19, 2:38:02 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Yes and are they going to display this?
[22/01/19, 2:39:00 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): Or show it to customers?
[22/01/19, 2:39:24 PM] Aanchal (ps): Usually the tin isn’t displayed but yes in the waxing room the tin is placed out before using

[22/01/19, 2:47:34 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): Then go as sober and classy as you can , Coz it will stand out in the midst of multiple coloured packaging
[22/01/19, 2:49:28 PM] Aanchal (ps): 👍🏻👍🏻Yes

[22/01/19, 2:51:38 PM] Aanchal (ps): 👍🏻👍🏻thank you
[22/01/19, 2:53:21 PM] Mansi Rastogi (ps): For the white you could add a light pastel pink bg instead like you have black for the charcoal. It would help in consistency when you have new flavours.

[22/01/19, 6:03:41 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I think it is unlikely to happen. 

OYO had been speaking with many other players too and they wanted to get something very cheap on an acquhire deal. Innov8 is already very richly valued. 

If the deal happens, then innov8 must be in serious distress, which may also be the case given they had taken some very big bets, many of them were not the most commercially prudent. Also their cofounder had recently left the company. So they had been in some serious flux.
[22/01/19, 6:06:15 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Personal message from Ritesh Malik on the news-

_Aree no no, this is baseless.. we've not entered into any agreement with them 😞_

[24/01/19, 3:09:03 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Hey guys, have a doubt, so in our saas product, we haven’t advertised anything in paid way, all the sales and clients acquired has been through word of mouth/referral but many potential investors ask for the customer acquisition cost, any idea on how to calculate when there is still no direct cost involved..
[24/01/19, 3:15:29 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Net Promoter Score (NPS) and benchmarking that to your industry should do it.
[24/01/19, 3:19:28 PM] Romil Shah (headstart): Costs traditionally associated with customer acquisition include marketing and advertising, incentives and discounts, and the staff associated with those business areas, along with other sales staff or contracts with external advertising firms. Incentives may be expressed in various formats, such as buy-one, get-one-free deals, receiving another product free with purchase, upgraded service at no additional cost to the customer, gift cards or bill credits.

[24/01/19, 3:21:05 PM] Romil Shah (headstart): It is not only marketing or advertisement spens but your sales team cost, other operational expenses  such as calls, travels, proof of concept time and cost etc..
[24/01/19, 3:22:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Wut? How does this relate?
[24/01/19, 3:22:34 PM] Neeraj Joshi: +1
[24/01/19, 3:23:50 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): The primary problem starts there, as of now to be true, no such team cost has incurred, don’t have a sales team as of now.. no calls/travels
If I had some sort of indirect cost or direct cost then would have directly divided it be new customers whom I acquired, but except my salary and rent, no other costs are there and that too I use from my other company
[24/01/19, 3:24:59 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): All my acquisitions were through fb groups only, no FB Ads or any sort of ads were pushed
[24/01/19, 3:26:11 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Good question. A Google search on how NPS scores are used should help you understand relationships. Incase you don't, feel free to PM

[24/01/19, 9:47:28 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): My cousin interned here
[24/01/19, 10:12:24 PM] Kartik Raichura (pushstart): Whatever you did on FB groups. The time that it would take for someone else to do it and the salary associated with it will be your cost of acquisition.

Suppose you paid 20k salary to someone to do that fb activity for a month and it got you 100 paid customers, then your acquisition cost is 20000/100 = 200

Secondly this model is not scalable, you cannot get 10 people to do and FB groups promotion coz FB will ban you after a certain time/scale. You will need to explore other channels in that case and so you have to pilot other channels as well and calculate your cac at scale.
[24/01/19, 10:21:58 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Thanks a lot for the insights, yeah I didn’t pay anyone, it was me only sharing on groups where I was active, and that was done with motive of awareness and not clients 😅 in the first place, my plan is to run promotions and that will surely make it easy to acquire and calculate it.. this time I got confused so
[24/01/19, 10:23:40 PM] Kartik Raichura (pushstart): No problem. Pm me if you need any more insights. Cheers
[24/01/19, 10:23:53 PM] shashank (pushstart): You are a marketing fellow. For you, Cost of acquiring a client will be  more easier to you than normal folks out here.
[24/01/19, 10:24:27 PM] Aditya Khanduri (ps): Maybe the time you took x your hourly rate
[24/01/19, 10:25:12 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Yeah the main doubt came as I didn’t pay anyone or I didn’t run campaigns, so calculating it , got confused
[24/01/19, 10:26:04 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Yeah... but the main problem is, that will be surely less than the real ones, so that’s why thinking
[24/01/19, 10:26:46 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): If I run campaigns then this cost might vary by a lot.. so investor shouldn’t feel like I am just giving him some random number for CAC
[24/01/19, 10:27:39 PM] shashank (pushstart): 😀
[24/01/19, 10:32:54 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Will surely pm you.. hope you won’t mind me disturbing
[25/01/19, 8:59:37 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Yes
[25/01/19, 9:09:07 AM] Amrik (pushstart): IMO the current CAC may not be relevant as it was an unorganised effort. More of a validation exercise. You should calculate and project the cost if you launch an aggressive campaign to on-board x paid clients. After funding you will have to go full throttle on customer acquisition.
[25/01/19, 9:37:38 AM] Bharatwaj (ps): Yeah that’s what my thought is

[25/01/19, 12:50:23 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): It needs fair bit of customization and you need to invest lot of time to it. 
It's good but requires lot involvement.

[25/01/19, 1:16:59 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): How many products you have in inventory? What is the scale of business you are working on? What kind of team do you have to manage the back end?
[25/01/19, 1:18:03 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): I would say exactly opposite of this . Shopify is robust, secure yet simple for beginners which makes it perfect to enter the e comm market. When you move ahead with more products, bigger team, woo commerce is beneficial because of level of customisation and scalability
[25/01/19, 1:18:22 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): And also, it would depend on your daily traffic and orders too
[25/01/19, 1:19:33 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): I second thought to saurabh
[25/01/19, 1:20:11 PM] Arjun (pushstart): Yup I agree. We moved from Shopify to woo commerce with scale
[25/01/19, 1:21:20 PM] shashank (pushstart): If everyone needs moved from Shopify then start with woo com then I'll say stick to woo from scratch :)
[25/01/19, 1:22:12 PM] shashank (pushstart): Stick to woo from start it helps
[25/01/19, 1:23:37 PM] shashank (pushstart): 5$ a server and within 10K you don't have to worry until you get traffic and are up for scaling & Dev costs.
[25/01/19, 1:25:50 PM] Hitesh Mehta (pushstart): I am going with the long term route, one time build.. but scalable. Shifting later maybe a long process and pricey affair. (from shopify, etc to larger platform)

Just my view..

I am building my online store as follows:

1. No template, 100% original design from base
2. Focus on UX
3. Technology: Angular, Php (wished for React, but not feasible)
4. Going a PWA route
[25/01/19, 1:25:53 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): Woo commerce is definitely advanced platform which would need higher skills to setup and manage. If you are starting out new in e commerce, I would say focus on thing which matter more in ROI i.e. product acquisition, strategy and marketing rather than putting in more effort on platform Configuration and customisation. And it isn’t that you got to migrate from shopify to woo within few days or months. There are shopify stores which have 5k-10k plus orders everyday and are running seamlessly
[25/01/19, 1:26:28 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): Although, if you have a good tech team in place , go for woo undoubtedly
[25/01/19, 1:26:44 PM] Vaibhav Adsul (pushstart): Not at all a good exp for me. Lot of blunders.Wont recomend.

[28/01/19, 4:20:07 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 here the small summary of my thoughts...


*Why Some People Have All the Luck?*


By Professor Richard Wiseman, University of Hertfordshire

*Why do some people get all the luck while others never get the breaks they deserve?*


A psychologist says he has discovered the answer.

Ten years ago, I set out to examine luck. I wanted to know why some people are always in the right place at the right time, while others consistently experience ill fortune.


I placed advertisements in national newspapers asking for people who felt consistently lucky or unlucky to contact me.


Hundreds of extraordinary men and women volunteered for my research and over the years, I have interviewed them, monitored their lives and had them take part in experiments.


The results reveal that although these people have almost no insight into the causes of their luck, their thoughts and behaviour are responsible for much of their good and bad fortune. 


Take the case of seemingly chance opportunities. Lucky people consistently encounter such opportunities, whereas unlucky people do not.


*I carried out a simple experiment to discover whether this was due to differences in their ability to spot such opportunities*


 I gave both lucky and unlucky people a newspaper, and asked them to look through it and tell me how many photographs were inside. I had secretly placed

a large message halfway through the newspaper saying:


 "Tell the experimenter you have seen this and win $50."

This message took up half of the page and was written in type that was more than two inches high. 


It was staring everyone straight in the face, but the unlucky people tended to miss it and the lucky people tended to spot it.


Unlucky people are generally more tense than lucky people, and this anxiety disrupts their ability to notice the unexpected.


As a result, they miss opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else. 


They go to parties'; intent on finding their perfect partner and so miss opportunities to make good friends.


They look through newspapers determined to find certain types of job advertisements and miss other types of jobs.


*Lucky people are more relaxed and open*, and therefore see what is there rather than just what they are looking for. 


*My research eventually revealed that lucky people generate good fortune via four principles*. 


They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good.


Towards the end of the work, I wondered whether these principles could be used to create good luck. I asked a group of volunteers to spend a month carrying out exercises designed to help them think and behave like a lucky person.

Dramatic results! 


These exercises helped them spot chance opportunities, listen to their intuition, expect to be lucky, and be more resilient to bad luck. One month later, the volunteers returned and described what had happened.


The results were dramatic: 80% of people were now happier, more satisfied with their lives and, perhaps

most important of all, luckier.


The lucky people had become even luckier and the unlucky had become lucky.


Finally, I had found the elusive "luck factor".




Here are Professor Wiseman';s four top tips for becoming lucky:


1) Listen to your gut instincts - they are normally right.


2) Be open to new experiences and breaking your normal routine.


3) Spend a few moments each day remembering things that went well.


4) Visualize yourself being lucky before an important meeting or telephone call.


Have a Lucky day and work for it...


*The happiest people in the world are not those who have no problems, but those who learn to live with things that are less than perfect*


"There is a great difference between worry and concern,

*A worried person only sees the problem and a concerned person solves the problem* ..!!

[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hey Pushstarters, 
From the past 45 days, we have been working towards CURATING our communities across Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru. 

Now its time to CURATE our Community in Mumbai!
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Why the CURATION?* 
Our aim @ Pushstart is to build a collaborative ecosystem for YOU to grow YOUR Business by making relevant knowledge and connections accessible to YOU at lightning fast speed! 

We believe that *relevant knowledge* should be accessible to everyone who wants to or is pursuing entrepreneurship and that’s why the *Pushstart FB Group*.  

But

*Relevant CONNECTIONS* should be only accessible to only Genuine Trustworthy people who are pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME.
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *What of CURATION* 
We are changing the Entry Criteria and Process to get into this Whatsapp Group. 

*New Criteria:* 
From now on we will allow ONLY and ONLY serious Genuine Entrepreneurs and Ecosystem players who are looking to GROW Venture in this Whatsapp group. 

We have realised that this group won’t create ROI for the ones who are startup enthusiasts and not really pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME as of now. 

FB Group would be more relevant for them to learn, pursue entrepreneurship and then become eligible to join this group.
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Process:* 
As we want this to be a highly CURATED and CLOSED community, from now on it is COMPULSORY for everyone to fill this form before becoming part of the community: http://bit.ly/Pushstartform.
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *How are we implementing the Change?* 
It's a request from all of you to fill this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform if you want to become part of our New Curated Community of Mumbai. 

The first deadline for form filling will be End of this Thursday. Kindly fill this form latest by day after tomorrow. 

Me and @919819946239 will be spearheading the Change!
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: This is the first step towards evolving this Community as a Premium offering. 

Will be sharing the whole new version in the near future! 

Hope we make sense here.

Let me know if you have any queries :)
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you have filled this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform. No need to fill it again
[29/01/19, 2:57:51 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you haven't, its time to *FILL IT NOW*. We will unfortunately have to remove you if your entry is not found in the form

[01/02/19, 11:35:41 AM] Hitesh Mehta (pushstart): Guys,

Need suggestions on Reseller Hosting Plans

1. Which one is the best provider (top of mind are GoDaddy, ResellerClub & BigRock)
2. This could be for 10-20 sites or unlimited sites
3. Need reliable & professional cPanel
4. Best in Pricing & Features
5. Is Cloud host a better option or Physical storage? 
6. Anything else that I need to know?

Thanks,
Hitesh
[01/02/19, 11:37:14 AM] shashank (pushstart): #1 SSD Nodes or DO / cloudways
#2 Avoid Shared hosting
#3 Cloyudways comes with own panel else Cpanel hosting 40$ a month something
#4 Cloudways or DO with Serverpilot
#5 CLOUD
[01/02/19, 11:42:05 AM] Bharatwaj (ps): 1)Better to go for vps and get an cpanel for extra
2)depends on ram, it could handle number of sites and also depends on the site usage.. so please say in specific 
3)cpanel is extra 11-15$ depending on providers
4)Pricing and features are directly proportional so more features then more price
5)cloud host also does have physical storage only, just that they have failover solutions in hand which gives them the term cloud
6)get the backup options, if they provide, wouldn’t suggest DO or lightsail as they are unmanaged so backup won’t be their headache, go for managed VPS
[01/02/19, 11:45:48 AM] shashank (pushstart): VPS budget mein hai kya?
[01/02/19, 11:47:31 AM] Bharatwaj (ps): Yeah 35-40$ me milta h.. pm aajao

[01/02/19, 11:30:30 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Hola Pushstarters!

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

So what's new?

PushQnA is not just gonna be a QnA session, but in addition to that the host would be sharing *original content* freshly brewed for Pushstarters! 

The content would be shared *3 days prior* to the QnA session and would be *101 themed* pertaining to the topic.

This content is specially for those who are curious about the topic and want to gain some basic knowledge much before the QnA. 

We're excited to begin with the new revamped PushQnA, which would happen *every Tuesday at 9:30 pm* 🤩🤩

[07/02/19, 12:03:21 AM] Romil Shah (headstart): We do our sessions at SPJIMR but it is our long term relationship. Are you looking for space only in Andheri or Navi Mumbai is fine..  You can try K J Somaiya or IITSOM  or Welingkers or Father Agnel Bandra ... I have few e-cell students who might be interested depending upon the session whether it is related to startup or generic session. Usually, if you crack a deal with an university where students have free entry and others paid... they do support in case their students are benefited and their program gets some value. May be try to crack a deal with NMIMS in case your sessions benefits from the program.. In the past we had tied up with https://hmmra.ac.in/ who is in media and journalism and has a good auditorium of 60-70 people.. and they wanted to promote entrepreneurship .. Headstart and Google Business Group use to host there but after their director moved out to Thadomal they restricted the access.. Thakur in Kandivali also drives such programs...
[07/02/19, 12:14:38 AM] Romil Shah (headstart): SPIT can give you space too in Andheri.. inside Bhavans campus

[18/02/19, 11:13:44 AM] Atijya (Pushstart): Looking for a connect at high impact organizations like :

World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary International. 

Why? 

For partnership / collaboration on a concept titled Safe Space Initiative where people gather together to share what they're going through with strangers. 

First event was held in Kolkata. 

Second event in Pune -- then Mumbai -- then Delhi. 

Organization : The Wall and Us - One of the largest volunteer run mental health organizations in the country with a team of 60 across the country and the globe (Canada, France, Ireland, US). 

Would appreciate a connect. Thank you. 😇
[18/02/19, 11:16:06 AM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): I love the passion i see in people and the variety of absolutely fascinating business opportunities people come up with.  I love the hustle and the reality element of the show. Most importantly, i love watching people rise, so the updates they give about people from the previous seasons and how well they are doing makes it outstanding. How the sharks operate is a great learning too.

[18/02/19, 4:08:46 PM] Aparna Ganesh (ps): of course situations are planned by the makers, they have an entire art design set4 up for each pitch too, but when you say scripted, it means it ALLLL is pre written, like what they are going to say exactly, and which shark is going to invest & how.....   that i do not buy. The programmers don't place any similar biz back to back in one ep, and a lot more planning goes on. thats obvious for any reality show, but the emotions are real, the deal is on the spot.
[18/02/19, 4:13:38 PM] ‪+91 98609 94384‬: I think shark tank is a marketing plaform which does good job promoting a product..deal are contigent like many do not get pass in due diligence any ways its fun to watch.

For a service based venture with initial focus on Indian customers and later global, what you recommend as a website extension, "something.in" OR "something.com" ?? Any rational ??
[20/02/19, 12:32:25 PM] Ameet (pushstart): If possible buy both.... And u can use .com

N redirect the .in to .com
[20/02/19, 12:34:46 PM] Ameet (pushstart): .Com to be used as it's perceived better than other extensions
[20/02/19, 12:35:09 PM] Hasan Sunara (pushstart): Thanks Ameet, I am looking for some insight on how customers may look at it , within India and abroad, does it matter customer acquisition standpoint?
[20/02/19, 12:35:34 PM] Ameet (pushstart): .Com to be used as it's perceived better than other extensions
[20/02/19, 12:36:42 PM] Rab Khan (ps): Yes, It does. .com is better if you have the option for both. I would suggest go with the .com
[20/02/19, 12:48:52 PM] ‪+91 98609 94384‬: Get .io too if its suitable..
[20/02/19, 12:50:26 PM] ‪+91 97570 22484‬: Suitable as in?
[20/02/19, 1:00:49 PM] ‪+91 98609 94384‬: Most use it as for information abbreviation as com is used for communication or company.just what suits if most get it as vanity domain.

[21/02/19, 8:48:24 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: Thank you Admin for adding me to the group and good morning everyone. 

I'm working on eliminating honking pollution from India, one of the most challenging and partially ignored problems. The reason why I believe honking (noise) pollution is not taken seriously is because it's not visible like air and water pollution, however, it's equally harmful. It causes high blood pressure, hypertension, hearing loss, sleep disturbance and serious cognitive decline amongst children.

We're aiming to solving the problem by incentivizing good behaviour. We're working on a device that counts the honks of the vehicle and communicates to the driver's phone app. The driver sees the incentives s/he would earn for honking lesser. 

Reason why I want to solve the problem is because driving is very close to my heart. I learnt driving in 3 days when I was 14 and have taught driving to a good few folks. Also, having lived in the USA for my Master's and work, made me aware of the ripple effect a peaceful commute can have on one's work productivity. And I'd like to bring that peace to the streets of India and peace of mind to Indians.

I'm facing two challenges with the startup: 1) Finding an app developer (potential co-founder) who would stick around and persevere until we figure out a business plan and gain traction. 2) Figuring out a business plan since we don't have a clear idea of how would this make money. I'm not in the favour of starting an NGO.

Any help would be welcomed with great regards.

[21/02/19, 8:49:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Lets have a call today evening
[21/02/19, 8:49:46 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Will try to help
[21/02/19, 8:49:48 AM] Neeraj Joshi: :)
[21/02/19, 8:50:01 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: Sure ty :)
[21/02/19, 8:55:31 AM] Shraddha Yeolkar (ps): Very interesting concept Rushabh. If the driver incentives are in the form of discounts or deals from brands, you can charge the brands for pushing their offers to your audience. Just a thought ..
[21/02/19, 8:59:21 AM] Nilesh (pushstart): Rishabh, it's a good idea
1. It can be rolled out as a part of CSR to corporates who have own or lease fleets for their employee transportation.
2. I think you should concentrate on getting this app approved by the Govt. And on the backside tie up with various fmcg and consumer companies ... gamefy the app such that points get accumulated and u get free stuff against those points.. Free stuff ofcourse be sponsored via this fmcg and consumer companies...
[21/02/19, 9:01:07 AM] Nilesh (pushstart): In the interim @917666656463 you could also earn revenue by 
1. Advertising
2. Install per unit cost
3. Data collection in terms of where maximum honking takes place.. What time honking takes place... advanced analytics
[21/02/19, 9:04:39 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What kind of device?
[21/02/19, 9:04:54 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Do you think people would be willing to put that decide in their cars?
[21/02/19, 9:05:05 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I won’t though
[21/02/19, 9:05:32 AM] Neeraj Joshi: The worst part: Buy that device 😳
[21/02/19, 9:05:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *device
[21/02/19, 9:06:04 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Great points sirji 🙌🏻☺️
[21/02/19, 9:06:15 AM] Batman (pushstart): You should connect with Anand Damani from Briefcase, they did a similar device for a corporate project.
[21/02/19, 9:06:29 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Woah
[21/02/19, 9:06:42 AM] Batman (pushstart): kinda like CreD.
[21/02/19, 9:07:31 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): Purely possible with the ecosystem of Android auto and ather mobiles and the BsVI regulations. 

Not sure if the car diagnostics helps you track on how many times you press your horn. 

But definitely an Intresting place. Red FM did a LOT on this with their why so horny campaign...if I got the name right.
[21/02/19, 9:07:53 AM] Batman (pushstart): He's also a Behavioral Scientist. They reduced they number of honks by a considerable amount I guess 30 or 60 %
[21/02/19, 9:09:27 AM] Nilesh (pushstart): @917666656463 most important clientele..car manufacturing companies...  this device becomes a part of new cars rolled out...
[21/02/19, 9:09:42 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Difficult to crack
[21/02/19, 9:11:42 AM] Nilesh (pushstart): Govt. Approval aaya.. To backend mandatory karke dal sakte.. See how all t permit cars by default now have to use speed governor's...  there was no need for speed governor's in India... as cars anyways don't go beyond 60
[21/02/19, 9:15:24 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: I know about Mr. Anand Damani's project Bleep. The difference between his project and ours is that we are not reliant on govt to implement our solution as a law since we don't restrict honking or penalize it. In fact, we're doing the opposite by rewarding. Only problem is we woke only be able to sell devices (not a good source of sustainable revenue though) only if we offer incentives that nobody else is offering, else why would someone take the pain of installing the device.
[21/02/19, 9:16:31 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Tie up with insurance companies and maybe give them analytical
[21/02/19, 9:16:34 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *tics
[21/02/19, 9:16:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Based on the honking behaviour of the driver
[21/02/19, 9:16:45 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: Car manf companies are highly skeptical. They will not onboard a solution until it is proven in the market.
[21/02/19, 9:17:03 AM] Neeraj Joshi: They would surely be interested in the data
[21/02/19, 9:17:18 AM] Batman (pushstart): You should ideally participate in these challenges floated by car companies, see if they can help you. Ideally, it's not a Consumer product.
[21/02/19, 9:17:35 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Incentive would be low insurance for my car if I am not a crazy honker
[21/02/19, 9:17:54 AM] Batman (pushstart): very difficult. they work on a mass scale. Have experience of selling a car product to them.
[21/02/19, 9:17:55 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Can’t be this straight but something along these lines
[21/02/19, 9:18:12 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: I've been trying to get in touch with insurance companies but haven't had much success yet. Also, a government grant would be extremely helpful since the startup has been bootstrapped for over a year now
[21/02/19, 9:18:43 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: And since I'm doing government's job... kinda
[21/02/19, 9:18:53 AM] Nilesh (pushstart): True ... u need volumes to sustain and even show case the benefits.. Start with call centres and companies like tata's who have a strong csr team..
[21/02/19, 9:19:07 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha
[21/02/19, 9:19:36 AM] Nilesh (pushstart): Someone from Pushstarter can get u in touch with Tata ka csr team

[21/02/19, 9:23:09 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Have you done research around gov grants?
[21/02/19, 9:23:26 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Any particular website to visit to get info arojnd the same?
[21/02/19, 9:26:30 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: Well... I know the departments that concern my project and I've sent emails upon emails .... CPCB, DSIR, NEERI, CSIR.
[21/02/19, 9:28:18 AM] ‪+91 76666 56463‬: None of them responded except DSIR for which I'll be applying to this month. Problem is they take a couple of years to award a grant.
[21/02/19, 9:28:39 AM] Neeraj Joshi: That’s the issue
[21/02/19, 9:29:10 AM] Neeraj Joshi: The government process is toooooooo slow
[21/02/19, 9:29:26 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Been dealing with them for an event hence the realisation

[25/02/19, 9:32:55 PM] Ani (Book): Hey guys, In my analysis, there isn't enough focused content on growth in India. Assume getting access to this content was not an issue, which of the following COURSES would be of interest to you? Imagine each of the courses are breakdowns of startups and companies on how they achieved that goal. For example, if the course is titled, "How To Get Your First 100,000 Visits To Your Site", the course content takes you through best practices and then gives you a breakdown of how over 25+ startups achieved 100,000 visits. 
Assuming these were the following courses available (in the document), which one would you be most interested in? You can select multiple options depending on what you like. I know its a lot of options but it would be cool to hear what you guys have to say: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2NGu_y-GIyIm7LBk0O-KNui1Z0CXZXW_kVfm0q2j-w/edit#gid=73479874

[27/02/19, 5:23:40 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): Got it. Nice brief. 
Thanks @919662915070 .. 

Just to clarify:
1. This is completely at individual discretion, regarding how much and what all to share.. No DOs & DON'Ts from you 

2. There is no connect to any commercial/social media campaign for any brand, industry lobby or political outfit.. No such connection for or from you .

Is this correct ?
[27/02/19, 5:25:21 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I am just a catalyst at this stage, no don't and dos as rules but ready to help with content, context and idea and will share your contet with others involved

[27/02/19, 5:27:55 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): you will have to write a custom java script and even then its difficult cos blue tick is not passed a paramter which you can cross check against
[27/02/19, 5:30:08 PM] ‪+91 98676 17649‬: People with less than 5k followers have blue ticks. I have a list of Twitter handles as per number of followers, but unfortunately not all of them have blue ticks. 🙄
[27/02/19, 5:31:44 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): blue tick has nothing to do with following, its to do with authenticity and verification that a celebrity claiming is infact the same person
[27/02/19, 5:32:55 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): do even if a so called celebrity will have 1 follower, they can get a blue tick, its basically to prevent others to imitate celebrities

[02/03/19, 10:50:35 AM] Salil (pushstart): Hey Pushstarters, 

Salil here

I and Madhusudhan Naik, we at Icapotech are working on building a platform that enables innovators, researchers, and prototypers to take their products to the end user.

Most of the innovators who develop their prototype at the nascent stage cannot take their  product to the end users because of lack of knowledge and resources. 
Every year India receives  approximately 12000 patents after the application, but the conversion of IP's to  product is rarely seen.
So we solve this problem,
Icapotech is a platform who helps innovators to develop their hardware prototype into products, with the customer centric approach.

We have a product named LightsOn, here is a small trailer of what it does. (it makes the existing lights in your home Smart, using your Smart Home and WiFi)
