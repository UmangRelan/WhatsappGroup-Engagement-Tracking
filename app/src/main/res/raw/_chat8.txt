[03/09/18, 8:49:04 AM] Akshay Kenkre(ps): Good morning Pushstarters. This is Akshay Kenkre. From today we are starting a specialised vertical for start-ups. Finance as an area is often the most critical piece of business and start ups often lack support in this area. We intend to fill the gap by handholding various start ups by mentoring, advising, working towards effective taxes and compliance. This would help you to clear due diligences and would enable a start up to be structured while seeking funds. We also have a strong M&A arm, which could help you navigate through your M&A times. We are not a PE or a fund but a trabsaction enabler. Investors do not look only at the idea, but also the viability of the execution of idea in a structured form. In case you have any questions, shoot an email to akshaykenkre@transprice.in or ping me on my number. Have a great week ahead.

From politics to blood mafia everyone is making it a commercial activity and innocent lives are damaged in this blood lust.. 

A few years ago, a few friends and myself worked on something to solve this problem and were faced with similar threats. Thanks to pushstart, ive met alot of people who have tried to do something similar and are still doing things in their personal capacity to solve this problem. 

I am seeking to connect to all such people who have tried solving this problems, through technology, NGOs or any other means!

Planning to unite them all and do something to have a huge impact. Pls DM me if you have the zeal, the passion and have tried solving this problem or tag someone you know who might be willing to collaborate and make this big!

The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Neeraj this side, the one who started Pushstart! 

We have come a long way from being an idea discussion platform to a community which helps you to grow your business. 

We are planning a few interesting things for the community. 

But before implementing them I would like to understand the current problems that you as pushstarters are facing and what can be done to solve them. 

Over this weekend I am planning to meet the maximum possible pushstarters to gain insights and feedback on the existing version of ps. 

If you can spare 30 mins of your time tomorrow or day after tomorrow, I would love to meet you over coffee. 

Do ping me if you would like to help and grow this community further.

CHEERS!
[24/11/18, 7:18:24 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!                                                                           

*Where to Apply?*

[04/12/18, 2:14:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: In Mumbai?
[04/12/18, 2:15:33 PM] Neeraj Joshi: That was not a judgement. That was just a open ended statement open for discussion
[04/12/18, 2:16:13 PM] Shreya Prakash FlexiBee Founder: Yeah from what I know and hear, Sheroes is a great place for women to connect, engage, find communities and interests, and avenues for grooming, upskilling, counseling, etc
[04/12/18, 2:17:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Pushstart is an open platform to share our opinion. That was just my opinion based on the kind of online engagement I have observed on the online forum. Feel free to share your opinion with stats if you differ. Peace ✌🏻
[04/12/18, 2:20:59 PM] Shubham Rai (Nodd): Of course - Peace -- And appreciate what you are trying to create -- It's just that we should be sensitive towards entrepreneurs - We all know it's tough -- DAU at Sheroes is 23.8%, Which is 2nd highest for any Indian social networking platform after ShareChat
[04/12/18, 2:21:11 PM] Shubham Rai (Nodd): Peace , Of Course 🤗😇

[05/12/18, 10:02:54 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: The lesson from a session i attended on export orientation for Indian entrepreneurs in WTC

You export -

First - Reputation of a country
Second - quality of product
3rd- specification of a product.

Think what comes to your mind when i name -

Products from -

Japan
Germany
China


😝

So if you want to sell something in long term sustainability in mind.
Sell the Quality not the specifications or features but the usability advantage for your customers.

It was so AMAZING to see Entrepreneurs from Delhi working on crazy stuff ranging from using AI for self-checkout at the retail outlet to using data for competitor analysis. 

40+ CURATED PushCEOs attended the PushConnect and shared about their Startup Journey which was accompanied by Networking over Snacks and Chai!

[06/12/18, 6:39:29 PM] Aparna Mohan (ps): Hello everyone, my intro comes a bit late, have been busy with multiple things. I attended the PushMeet a couple of months back and am delighted to see the support this group has to offer to niche players like us. 

My name is *Aparna Mohan*, and I am the founder of travel boutique *Let’s Get Lost*. It was my passion to share my unique travel concepts with people, that made me start this 3 years ago. We organise off- beat excursions across India, interest based overnight camps around Mumbai-Pune, and occasional travel meetups. 

We focus on adventure, cultural immersion and being responsible while traveling. We love to organise small sized group tours and also consult on & book customised tours for individuals.

Would love to build fruitful partnerships through this platform and grow the brand. Please check out my social media presence:

Like someone said, we are all struggling to make it happen, some more than others. So we must understand and include everyone in the community and not throw them out of the group or be rude to them. Doesn’t show well on a community thats here to support. 

Hey @918779219493  ... you should draft a set of rules applicable on this group, and share them with anyone who joins the group and periodically share on the group too so everyone knows. If anyone makes a mistake just politely remind them of the mistakes and give them a chance.

[14/12/18, 5:12:16 PM] Aakriti (ps): Hello Pushstarters! 
Neeraj added me to the group recently, I think I need to introduce myself and what I'm doing so here goes -
[14/12/18, 5:13:46 PM] Aakriti (ps): I'm an IIM Calcutta alumnus with a consulting background, who loves the consulting way of structuring and approaching problems, but being interested in dev sector, moved from a McK to an FSG, working with foundations such as Gates and Rockefeller Foundation on complex social issues. I realised there's still a huge gap in the potential to bridge social impact needs (health, employment, etc.) with solely Foundation-led interventions, and set up Unbound to work with the private sector, riding on profit motives, to create momentum towards positive social impact.

We work with orgs to identify potential leverage points for profit+impact, with a Systems Approach, which is used by large foundations like Rockfeller and also by the British government to design policies.
[14/12/18, 5:14:35 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): I can connect him.  Was mentoring a startup in same space.
[14/12/18, 5:15:06 PM] Aakriti (ps): I'm conducting a super interesting talk on the role of a Systems mindset to intervene in complexity, in Worli tomorrow - would love to have some of you guys attend the meetup.
[14/12/18, 5:15:44 PM] Aakriti (ps): Sharing the event collateral for reference - do share your thoughts on the idea and the vision, with me
[14/12/18, 5:16:39 PM] Aakriti (ps): _Why does great intent coupled with a great team still not lead to great impact?_
_How to engage in the complex education system within India?_
_When will we act to curtail the threats of climate change?_

With organisations ranging from the *Rockefeller Foundation* and the *Acumen Fund*, to *Boeing*, to even *the British Government* embedding this approach in their work towards SDGs & towards designing for the future, it’s high time to understand the potential Systems practice holds. Systems thinking is a new wave of thinking posing important questions to the future of development approaches and the work we do towards impact. 

Join us for this enlightening talk and an in-depth panel discussion, where we discuss a "Systems Approach" to complex problems, with *Vikram Jain, Director, FSG*, talking about his market-based solution for India's education sector, sharing his perspective from the trenches, and Prof. *Sandy Smith-Nonini, Anthropologist, University of North Carolina*, elaborating on why our current approaches are still insufficient to address the complex challenges we face as humanity. The fascinating subject and panel will be moderated by *Aakriti Gupta, CEO, Unbound*, who brings in her expertise from her work with the private sector and the development sector, to discuss the challenges and advantages of using a Systems mindset. 

_Panel followed by refreshments, and an opportunity to network with colleagues from across top firms in the development as well as private sector._

[19/12/18, 11:29:23 AM] Omkar Dhareshwar (pushstart): Hey guys,

I run a graffiti agency called Wicked Broz and from time to time we work with some really interesting artists who come to meet us from other parts of the globe. I thought it would be a nice experiment if they not only explored the streets of Mumbai and painted with our Indian crews but also got to interact with the startup eco-system of the country. Who knows what might come about from there.

Currently we have one such artist from Coquimbo, Chile here with us till 14th Jan. Rikis Santander works and travels in Chile as a graffiti artist and is well known in his city for his masterful works. We first met him in Brazil couple of years at rhe Streets of Style graffiti festival. He is here in India now to meet us and has already painted at the ISBT in Jabalpur Street art festival and for Paint My City campaign happening in Prayagraj.

PM me if someone would like to meet him or if he can be invited to the upcoming Pushmeetups or other startup meets till he is here. He would be happy to interact and see if collaborations are possible.

Any suggestions are welcome
[19/12/18, 7:33:42 PM] ‪+91 96996 80721‬: no regulation as such
[19/12/18, 7:34:20 PM] Harsh Vaidya Tedx: So just form a company with the object to raise funds and start?
[19/12/18, 7:34:47 PM] ‪+91 96996 80721‬: u cant even have object to raise funds
[19/12/18, 7:37:11 PM] Apoorva Goel (ps): Im not sure if there is any regulation for or against it in India but Indiegogo seems to be a good choice. Have you looked into that yet?

[19/12/18, 7:43:07 PM] Harsh Vaidya Tedx: Thanks a lot
[19/12/18, 7:45:23 PM] Harsh Vaidya Tedx: The reason why I asked is because I’ve been approached by an investee company who is raising funds in Very small tranches from individuals and forming a fund which will inturn invest in ventures 

Just wanted to understand if under the pretext of crowdfunding having being badly scratched by sahara and a few other chitfund companies
Is this practice a legit one any more?
[19/12/18, 7:45:29 PM] Satish Kataria ( Ps): I run Catapooolt - which is India's leading crowdfunding platform. You cannot raise equity crowdfunding in India

Lemme go through catapooolts website and understand what it does in details
[19/12/18, 7:46:35 PM] Satish Kataria ( Ps): They have to do this through forming an AIF under SEBI, or it has to be kind of private placement,
[19/12/18, 7:46:54 PM] ‪+91 96996 80721‬: Ye AiF is preferred

[21/12/18, 1:04:37 PM] Brijesh Tejani (ps): Zoho CRM and Agile CRM are the cheapest and most feature rich.

[26/12/18, 11:55:08 AM] Rushabh (ps): Hey Fellow Entrepreneurs,
It's time to take a step back and THINK!

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

Register Now to Avail!

Hello Pushstarters, I am Kaushal Sovani - an Entrepreneur, Designer, Textile crazy,  Occasional Blogger, BabyWearing enthusiast and a Dreamer.

I am into the business of making a difference, in how newborns are dressed, carried and cared for. 
My experience of working with children (in my previous avatar as a Special Educator) has helped me design and make fuss free yet trendy clothes for them. 
Creating clothes for babies is now my full time passion and there is always something new on our design table. 
We have worked with organizations to provide gift hampers for newborna,  New Parents,  at BabyShower etc. 

I am looking forward for meaningful connections and conversations from Pushstarters to take this ahead in organizations Pan India.

[29/12/18, 10:34:43 AM] Satish Kataria ( Ps): I wonder why can't consumers file a PIL against such non-consumer friendly regulations?
[29/12/18, 11:02:20 AM] Ayan (fabindia): What about millions of small hard goods brands who all are working hard staying afloat comparing with a few big sharks.
[29/12/18, 11:12:36 AM] Satish Kataria ( Ps): Protectionism is never good for any market. No one stops them to try for making better products and do clearly segmented marketing. Any good product then sells irrespective of pricing.
[29/12/18, 11:27:34 AM] Ayan (fabindia): Agree from your business view. But there need to be a even field, for the government of any country  to structure the economy for a more optimised growth. It is happening across the globe now. Govt cannot favour any particular zoner. Economy doesn't run on better products it runs on market.
[29/12/18, 11:28:52 AM] Jayanta (ps): +1
[29/12/18, 11:37:20 AM] Chintal(pushstart): That's not true. That's over simplification. They don't get that kind of credit lines and deals with manufacturing units and other costs that will let them do lower pricing. It's called economies of scale. That's private equity vs public funding. Big sharks have abundant resources that they use to first wipe off the competition and then increase the price.
[29/12/18, 11:38:38 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: Odd thing to do for a govt which itself favours certain private players to d extent of imposing those on consumers, isn't it🤔 the field shd b even through out

Shoestring experience

[31/12/18, 10:55:38 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: ✌🏼
[31/12/18, 10:56:03 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: Personally the one of biggest challenge has been to justify not offering cash on delivery
[31/12/18, 10:57:31 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: We take our products back only if it is damaged in shipping or a wrong product is sent
[31/12/18, 10:58:24 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: Understood. best policy for India No COD. Still denial of COD can happen.
[31/12/18, 10:58:55 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: And here ppl are so used to free returns without reason due to d trend set by amazon n flipkart that its a big challenge for us to get ppl to buy from our site
[31/12/18, 11:00:18 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: Amz Flip doing business at sellers expense. No wonder they offer elephant  egg on the same table.
[31/12/18, 11:00:43 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: I would call u in sometime if you dont mind
[31/12/18, 11:01:13 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: Yes coz we are not a big brand to b able to manage the shipping cost we incur coz of COD,  earlier it was 60rs per delivery, not sure abt now, ppl also expect free shipping and der is a limit to how much cost can b added on d product itself to even out d shipping charges
[31/12/18, 11:03:43 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: And with COD der r ppl who simple change their mind n send the product back, dat too causes a loss for us in terms of reshipping, manpower n efforts lost and also it is difficult when we have fragile items to b shipped
[31/12/18, 11:04:18 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: Give me a call after 7 in d eve, will b going in for a meeting in sometime
[31/12/18, 11:04:39 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: ✌🏼
[31/12/18, 11:05:36 AM] Kaushal Sovani (ps): Agree to this
Same here.
[31/12/18, 11:23:10 AM] ‪+91 99875 77339‬: 👍
[31/12/18, 11:38:55 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: I read somewhere an Indian company took a dig marketing firm to increase sales. They were given some % on each order. What the firm did was created fake accounts , incentivized other dig marketing firms to create fake orders on COD and then reject on delivery. 
This dig marketing company looted them on commission per order and the company lost money on returned order shipping cost.
[31/12/18, 5:24:50 PM] Purnima Jha (ps): I am looking for teachers and Center Director for our Klay prep school& daycare at worli and lower parel.

So at the end of the day it’s a business call whether you want to do it or not. I know a lot of independent sellers who don’t offer it because they believe it’s a headache

The nature of transactions are subscriptions/ purchase of credits for using a tech platform on the startup's www (and NOT on any e-commerce aggregator www).

Some experts recommend YES - however this article suggests otherwise -  https://quaderno.io/blog/saas-businesses-indias-online-service-tax/ | It'll be great to hear from you!!! Many thanks. Please DM.
[08/01/19, 9:27:17 AM] Brijesh Tejani (ps): Yes. It's okay if you don't have a GST number until you reach the 20 lacs limit.
[08/01/19, 9:27:23 AM] Brijesh Tejani (ps): But it is advisable to register the firm or at least register the GST.
[08/01/19, 9:28:34 AM] Brijesh Tejani (ps): You should consult a Chartered Account for this. He/she will be able to understand the use case better and guide accordingly!
[08/01/19, 9:55:23 AM] ‪+91 97231 15763‬: If you are sure that your sales will cross the limit than it is advisory that to take GST registration,cause it will be helpful in taking the tax credit of inward invoices from the date of registration.

[17/01/19, 10:02:47 AM] ‪+91 91670 44053‬: We talk about relationships in sales business development. Some people just mix it with bad ideas of getting closer with hidden  agenda of getting / selling something  long chatting talking..coffe etc few of those tricks. Basically rubbing the other one to the point he gets irritated to throw some kind of forced deals that mostly not gets materialized due to its sheer onesided less interested throw away nature.

The real relationship kick starts immediately when you first give something to the other one again and again instead of asking sly return first. 

The law of attraction says do it 4 times. 

I have experimented this too. Even before i ask for something offer has been poured in to me. Offer someone your skills, expertise, experience free of cost. And see what happens. 

Those who into sales try it out. You are not able to sell because you are trying to force your way to sell. Instead pls be genuine to help and offer values and seek nothing in return. You need not to ask, things will come back to you in multitudes of what you offered free.

There is a lot of confusion around whether to add your friends to FB and then here or the other way around. 

In the past 2 weeks, a lot of pushstarters have reached out to me asking *how to add people in their network to this community?*

It’s pretty simple, just share this form with the interested folks in your network, we will add them here directly after going through their profile once 😋😋

Sounds good? 

Then start sharing this registration form with fellow founders in your network:

[29/01/19, 2:54:53 PM] ‪+91 98196 16803‬: Hi guys needed a lil advice. I would be travelling to Canada to see my family. Travel dates are -
Leave       30 th June 2019
Return    26 th July 2019

I have 2 passports. Old and new. My new passport is issued and valid till 2028. My Canadian visa is expiring on 21st Sep 2019 and was issued in my old passport. Will I be able to travel or there would be an issue? Just wanted to confirm before I booked my tickets. 

Any inputs??
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hey Pushstarters, 
From the past 45 days, we have been working towards CURATING our communities across Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru. 

Now its time to CURATE our Community in Mumbai!
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Why the CURATION?* 
Our aim @ Pushstart is to build a collaborative ecosystem for YOU to grow YOUR Business by making relevant knowledge and connections accessible to YOU at lightning fast speed! 

We believe that *relevant knowledge* should be accessible to everyone who wants to or is pursuing entrepreneurship and that’s why the *Pushstart FB Group*.  

But

*Relevant CONNECTIONS* should be only accessible to only Genuine Trustworthy people who are pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME.
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *What of CURATION* 
We are changing the Entry Criteria and Process to get into this Whatsapp Group. 

*New Criteria:* 
From now on we will allow ONLY and ONLY serious Genuine Entrepreneurs and Ecosystem players who are looking to GROW Venture in this Whatsapp group. 

We have realised that this group won’t create ROI for the ones who are startup enthusiasts and not really pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME as of now. 

FB Group would be more relevant for them to learn, pursue entrepreneurship and then become eligible to join this group.
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Process:* 
As we want this to be a highly CURATED and CLOSED community, from now on it is COMPULSORY for everyone to fill this form before becoming part of the community: http://bit.ly/Pushstartform.
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *How are we implementing the Change?* 
It's a request from all of you to fill this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform if you want to become part of our New Curated Community of Mumbai. 

The first deadline for form filling will be End of this Thursday. Kindly fill this form latest by day after tomorrow. 

Me and @919819946239 will be spearheading the Change!
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: This is the first step towards evolving this Community as a Premium offering. 

Will be sharing the whole new version in the near future! 

Hope we make sense here.

Let me know if you have any queries :)
[29/01/19, 2:56:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you have filled this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform. No need to fill it again
[29/01/19, 2:57:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you haven't, its time to *FILL IT NOW*. We will unfortunately have to remove you if your entry is not found in the form

Does anyone here know someone who works in food  NGO which feeds poor or is related to food waste management? 

Have an interesting thought for tackling food waste.
Please PM me.
[01/02/19, 1:44:20 PM] Ruchika Surekha: There’s Robin Hood army.
[01/02/19, 1:44:28 PM] Ruchika Surekha: There’s Feed India.

[01/02/19, 1:45:17 PM] Ruchika Surekha: Okay. PM please?
[01/02/19, 1:46:43 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Pmed you. :)
[01/02/19, 1:49:42 PM] Rajesh Khemani(ps): No tax upto total taxable Income of 5Lakh is in the form of rebate under section 87A which means *It will be available to only those Individuals whose Total Taxable Income is less than or equal to 5Lakh (after availing all available deductions).*

*There is no change in Tax slabs and there is no exemption to those Individuals whose total Taxable Income (after all deductions) is more than 5Lakh.*
[01/02/19, 1:50:28 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): so kutch fayed hai ki nahi?
[01/02/19, 1:56:11 PM] Ronak Banka (ps): Of course benefits are there
[01/02/19, 1:56:30 PM] Ronak Banka (ps): Basic exemption limit is doubled from 2.5 L to 5L
[01/02/19, 1:56:44 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): ok
[01/02/19, 1:56:57 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): got it
[01/02/19, 1:59:22 PM] Nishant (Beingjigyasu): No. That's the catch. It's doubled for only those whose income after deductions comes below or equal to 5 Lakhs. 

E.g. if someone earns 6.5 Lakhs and invests in tax saving instruments upto 1.5 Lakhs (upper limit of 80C), then the individual doesn't have to pay any tax at all.

But if you earn more than that or you're unable to bring post deduction income to 5 lakhs or less, then the 2.5 Lakh slab and 5 Lakh slabs remains as is.
[01/02/19, 2:01:07 PM] Satish Kataria ( Ps): Are you sure on this?

If your net taxable income after availing all the deductions under section 80C to 80U of the Income tax act does not exceed Rs 5 lakh, then you will not be required to pay any tax. However, if your net taxable income (after availing deductions under section 80C to 80U), exceeds Rs 5 lakh then taxes will be calculated as per the current tax structure._

[01/02/19, 11:30:31 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Hola Pushstarters!

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

.

.

Rings a bell?? 🤔🤔
.
.
.
Yeah, you're right- It's *#PushQnA.* 😎😎

We're back with an *all new* version of *PushQnA*, starting *next week*.🔥🔥

So what's new?

PushQnA is not just gonna be a QnA session, but in addition to that the host would be sharing *original content* freshly brewed for Pushstarters! 

The content would be shared *3 days prior* to the QnA session and would be *101 themed* pertaining to the topic.

This content is specially for those who are curious about the topic and want to gain some basic knowledge much before the QnA. 

We're excited to begin with the new revamped PushQnA, which would happen *every Tuesday at 9:30 pm* 🤩🤩

Stay Tuned for further updates!!

most often it happens when u are setting up a fb ad account for a client... nd then he's adding the credit card from his ip address...

Stop wasting ur time with FB support. for me it wasn't resolved even after 40 days....

[08/02/19, 9:50:27 AM] Apoorva Goel (ps): Agencies say that it's happened to other clients to put your mind at ease. Our Instagram account got banned for no reason some time ago and we appealed it to support. I think it took a couple weeks to come back.
[08/02/19, 10:07:23 AM] Nilanjana (ps): The backend text analytics could be the reason since sometime some words used in the posts / adv are red flagged irrespective of the reason it is used for !
Drawbacks of machine learning and AI maybe😃... the backend team usually sorts this
[08/02/19, 10:12:36 AM] Arjun (pushstart): Got back live within 24 hours
[08/02/19, 10:12:42 AM] Arjun (pushstart): Appealed to fb
[08/02/19, 10:14:28 AM] Mohit Ghate (ps): It did happen to a lot of brands across the world. It's mainly due to one big change that's coming to Facebook advertising, i.e. campaign level budgeting instead of ad set level.

[07/03/19, 9:42:06 AM] Harsh Vaidya Tedx: I am currently in a fix hence posting this on the group there is a bit of help needed from someone in delhi (this will be remunerated)

The challenge is
somewhere in Haryana we have ordered some teapots to be given for some event as gifts

Now these are very fragile clay teapots
They need to be sent to mumbai from there and the potter is angutha chap and has no packaging expertise 

If I want to courier these 100 pots to mumbai via fedex I will have to ensure they are packed extremely well

These pots can be delivered to delhi by the potter but in normal boxes

Where can I find some service who can pack these boxes so well that they can be picked by fedex

I can even arrange an innova which can get these here privately just that they have to be packed so well that they don’t break in transit
[07/03/19, 10:28:46 AM] Ayan (fabindia): PM me.
[07/03/19, 10:49:14 AM] Rajesh Khemani(ps): Hi All ,

Looking for connection at Liv Fin , new age NBFC for Invoice Discounting Program. Suggestion for any other lender is also welcome.
[07/03/19, 11:22:29 AM] Bhavik (pushstart): Hi all, what could be the subject of mail which is been sent after meeting a client, just to share that we were happy meeting her & glad that she has shared her requirement etc
[07/03/19, 11:34:55 AM] ‪+91 98193 05574‬: "thank you for your time", "Great meeting you"
[07/03/19, 11:36:20 AM] Bharat Jethani (ps): After a meeting or chat, it’s often useful to document the agreed actions. This gives everyone clarity on next steps. It’s also a useful audit trail for us.

Here’s a follow-up email that works well…

Subject: Our actions following today’s meeting. Please can you…

Dear (Name)

I enjoyed our meeting.

As promised, this email confirms the actions we agreed.

My actions:

     
      
Yours:

      
If I’ve missed anything, please let me know.

As agreed, we’ll meet again at (time) on (date), to finalise our next steps.

This wording works well because:

The title engages – “please can you…” encourages them to open the email – they want to see what the second half of the sentence is
The wording is very joint – “our meeting” and so on
The word “agreed” reinforces we’ve agreed things
We’ve both got actions – so it’s joint and fair
You put your actions before theirs
You’ve documented when you’re meeting again. So things happen with pace
Most of all: it’s better than NOT sending one. That makes things go too slowly. Or not at all.

Action Point

Create a standard follow-up email (or just use this one). You can then use it after every meeting – a quick way to get more done.

Here is the link to my talk on influencer marketing. Hope it helps
[08/03/19, 7:09:42 PM] Omkar Dhareshwar (pushstart): Hey everyone, first of all a very happy women's day! I run Wicked Broz, a graffiti company. I want to announce something big I'm doing with Wicked Broz by the end of this month. Hope some of you feel it's a just cause and come forward to help us out.
[08/03/19, 7:10:32 PM] Omkar Dhareshwar (pushstart): In January of this year, we undertook a week long trip across Rajasthan upto Agra with a couple of friends from around the world. There was Rikis Santander, a street artist from Chile and Abigail Aroha Jensen, a contemporary artist from New Zealand. We all went mad clicking epic pictures of each other in every pose one can think of at the forts, in the palaces and all over the streets. And the compelling stories of those places made it all the more epic. However, something hit us a few days after this magical trip was over. 
Rikis said two things about the gullies of India - one, they are so crowded (no surprise) and two, there are very few women in this crowd. 

Now that’s not something we didn’t know before. We’ve seen it all our lives. And we even know why it is so!
But maybe that’s why this statement coming from a foreigner missiled into our brain. 
Why? Why is our country so fucked up? 

So we took Rikis’ observation back to Marol, the home of the Wicked Broz, where we’d been planning a hip hop festival for months. Now, we had a new meaning to it. 

Ladies First is a women-led street art festival. The first of its kind in India. Our endeavour is to promote women street artists and in turn bring more women to the streets in India. Back to the basics, dude! Represent. Hip-hop. 

For the first version of our festival that’s going to be held from 25 Mar to 31 Mar, 7 brilliant female artists have come together - 

Anpu, a well known name in the Indian Street Art scene who’s signature cat stencil is always a delight to spot. 
Sam Sam, a part of the first wave of graffiti artists in India who’s been at it for almost a decade now. 
Avantika Mathur, who’s bringing all the boho vibes with her wherever she goes and using surrealism to convey her truth. 
Shirin Shaikh, a solo traveler who’s heart and art are both closest to nature. 
Kesar Khinvasara, the goddess of mandalas whose inspiration comes from the most basic element of drawing - a line. 
Ratna Singh, whose style is all about bringing Warli art to the walls of the world. 
And Abigail Aroha Jensen (yes, the same one we mentioned before), whose fresh, modern style has been a part of the first transgender art fest in Prayagraj. 

All of us together hope to bring more power to the women on the streets, way beyond the walls of Marol and Mumbai. 

What else we hope to do is to bring together leading figures in Indian Street art to come and speak about women, art and their experiences. If you want to simply pick up a brush and get moving, we have through street art workshops for you too! 
And if you want to just come check out the scene and learn a little about where it all comes from, we’ve got screenings and graffiti tours for you to show how art has been taking over the streets for the last few years. 

Wicked Broz has sprung from hip-hop. We can never forget that. So in spirit of that, we’ll also be hosting a cypher on the last day of the festival calling out all b-girls and female rappers! 

Through Ladies First we hope to change the gender representation and inclusion in the scene a little bit, to push the needle against what is considered taboo. You see, nothing is a waste of time ladies and gentleman! 
Shaitani bina bachpan choro, zindagi bekar hai dude. 

If you want to join our movement as a volunteer/ collaborator/ partner/ sponsor, reach out to us at 8887795823 or email us ladiesfirststreetart@gmail.com/zain@wickedbroz.com. 

See you at the streets!
