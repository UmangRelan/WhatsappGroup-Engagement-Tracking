[02/06/18, 9:11:44 AM] ‪+91 83760 83676‬: I just checked your website. Here are some of my thoughts on it:

1) Too much spammy. Right off the bat, I'm bombarded with "notification" window and "fb messenger notifications". 
2) Affiliate links EVERYWHERE. 
3) "GeneratePress" in footer makes your website look generic. 
4) I can't see a single post without any affiliate links. 
5) Did I mention affiliate links?
6) You are not providing enough value to the readers.

I don't even call myself a DM specialist, but I'm guessing that VERY few of the "visitors" are "readers" on your website. Wouldn't it better for you to create a better funnel (using Clickfunnels probably) and redirecting them to your blog by providing an incentive (maybe a free ebook) - this will surely help you increase the opt-in ratio for your email lists. 

Good luck!

[03/06/18, 10:02:20 AM] Shashank Srivastava (ps): Thanks for such a valuable thoughts.
I don't call myself an expert at all.
That is my experimentation website and i test all the things that i have to use in my money blogs. That is the reason it looks like a mess.
Not removing Generate Press credits. Yes there is a reason behind this which is also a part of experiment i did in my initial days of this blog and i never removed.
I don't collect emails on that website.
But you can go to Top Courses - Free Digital Marketing Course and you'll get a lead magnet there.
Affiliate links are everywhere that's right.
Because you seen i think first page feed on homepage with few articles only.
Check more please.
Overall i am glad you took your time out to review.
I'll surely try making my site cleaner.

[03/06/18, 11:18:35 AM] Bits Spark: Had a related question. 

Has anyone contemplated the idea of working out of the hills or smaller towns? 

The rent is minimal, the environment is amazing and you get most of the amenities from City life w/o the hassle. 

I'm contemplating this personally and would love to hear of thoughts/suggestions or of someone is doing that?
[03/06/18, 11:19:13 AM] Bits Spark: I know freelancers do this a fair bit in Himachal and across the world as well
[03/06/18, 11:21:04 AM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: HP is a good location as few of my freelancer frnds are doin it but never heard a complete startup gang moving their base to tier2-3 city from tier1 for the obvious reasons
[03/06/18, 11:22:32 AM] Bits Spark: The obvious being?
[03/06/18, 11:23:18 AM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: Funds alinment + team building resourses + meetups
[03/06/18, 11:24:02 AM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: Startups from Chandigarh or Ludhiana move to either Delhi NCR or to Bangalore
[03/06/18, 11:24:18 AM] ‪+91 83760 83676‬: Yeah, people call it the "digital nomad" life.
[03/06/18, 11:26:01 AM] Bits Spark: Yes, it's a concept I'm familiar with. Its usually for individuals and not teams. 

Which is why I asked for, has anyone here tried it?
[03/06/18, 11:27:19 AM] Shashank Srivastava (ps): One of my friend is shifting to Dharamshala next week for same. Will keep you guys posted on same...
I personally can't handle more than 3-4 days in Mountains.
[03/06/18, 11:27:50 AM] Bits Spark: Could you elaborate on what you mean by team building resources? 

Are you referring to hiring?
[03/06/18, 11:28:12 AM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: Yes 🤓
[03/06/18, 11:28:18 AM] Bits Spark: Could you please ask him if he would be open to having a chat?
[03/06/18, 11:29:33 AM] Bits Spark: So you feel that folks are unwilling to move to a smaller city for work and hence you lose out?

Or are you referring to the random chance meetings that can happen in a city that helo you find hire?
[03/06/18, 11:29:34 AM] Shashank Srivastava (ps): Let me try...
Or you can check for Jayan Kumar on facebook handling Roundtable events.
He is the same guy.
[03/06/18, 11:30:33 AM] Bits Spark: An introduction would be great, if it's not too much of a bother?
[03/06/18, 11:31:14 AM] Shashank Srivastava (ps): Don't worry. Good guy. My name would suffice. 😃
[03/06/18, 11:31:28 AM] Bits Spark: Sure, thanka
[03/06/18, 11:31:32 AM] Shashank Srivastava (ps): Your name sir?
[03/06/18, 11:31:44 AM] Bits Spark: Rahul Seth
[03/06/18, 11:32:14 AM] Shashank Srivastava (ps): Thanks. Will tell him you'll contact for a discussion.

[04/06/18, 2:10:25 PM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: Is pushevent a diff platform just inquiring.
[04/06/18, 2:15:25 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Well, its a different fb group where in people can share events and everything related.. when initially we started at pushstart group, event posting started growing.. now its good to be aware but as u might have seen with a lot of other startup groups, it ultimately ends up being a link dumping or promotional event sharing.. soo pushevents was created for 2 reasons. 1. To safeguard the interests of pushstarters and not spam their walls with events instead be true and share knowledge & 2. To actually share interesting events near you where in you would want to know more about, connect or attend with fellow pushstarters. 

Thanks to the good community folks, we have been able to do both 1 and 2 to some extents

[13/06/18, 11:01:09 AM] Akash (pushstart): To help me with softwares and other tech support. 😐
[13/06/18, 11:01:22 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Why not hire someone?
[13/06/18, 11:01:48 AM] ‪+91 78984 98881‬: What is it that you are trying to accomplish
[13/06/18, 11:04:41 AM] Akash (pushstart): I am bringing up a new Startup in education sector.  I need a tech guy in my team. I am not at all a techie so in that case I am not able handle these developers and we face a lot of problems in it. Moreover we want to customize our softwares as per our product. So, we need a person who can translate our needs and be a partner with us. We are a team of two already.
[13/06/18, 11:06:20 AM] Akash (pushstart): Hiring someone won't solve the issue I think. I want someone to be with me always. Hired people go for holidays whenever they need. Partners are found to be more committed. And when your main USP is your software, your product depends on this software, you need someone who can handle it or handle employees who are working on this.
[13/06/18, 11:10:34 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Do u really think u will get a cofounder and that too a tech just by asking around?
[13/06/18, 11:10:43 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *techie
[13/06/18, 11:11:08 AM] Neeraj Joshi: And that too a good techie
[13/06/18, 11:27:36 AM] Harshit Jain (pswhatsapp): If asking around won't get him tech co founder, what exactly should do?

[13/06/18, 11:28:30 AM] ‪+91 96465 00758‬: This description is very vague
[13/06/18, 11:29:49 AM] Neeraj Joshi: yes. First talk abt your idea. Don't tell you are looking for a cofounder because that doesn't happen in a day.
[13/06/18, 11:30:02 AM] Neeraj Joshi: and you also shouldn't do it in a day
[13/06/18, 11:30:28 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Let him/her work with you without the pressure of you or him/her calling himself/herself a cofounder
[13/06/18, 11:30:38 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Work for 1-2 months
[13/06/18, 11:30:56 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Try to penetrate your vision and mission

[13/06/18, 11:31:27 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): 🤩
[13/06/18, 11:31:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: See if you are comfortable working and being with him/her. See if you can trust him/her
[13/06/18, 11:31:52 AM] Neeraj Joshi: and the other way around. Even he/she should feel the same
[13/06/18, 11:32:11 AM] Neeraj Joshi: it takes at least 2 months to take a decision
[13/06/18, 11:32:23 AM] Neeraj Joshi: and it should be the ideal process of onboarding a cofounder
[13/06/18, 11:32:47 AM] Akash (pushstart): You are right. But bat bhi usse karunga na bhai jo pehle skill wise requirements meet kre. Or pehle mile to sahi. Tab to 2 mahine baad decision lunga. I got some really serious calls btw with this post. 😅
[13/06/18, 11:33:13 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Then don't post that u are looking for a cofounder
[13/06/18, 11:33:24 AM] Neeraj Joshi: You are indeed looking for a techie
[13/06/18, 11:33:25 AM] Neeraj Joshi: first
[13/06/18, 11:34:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Techies work on interesting things usually. So it is not necessarily required that he/she should have interest in edtech
[13/06/18, 11:34:48 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Education on a whole

Most of CV’s there are just plain cvs with no intention of looking for a job. There is always a difference when people apply themselves for a job vs you call then and say hey, are you looking for a job? 
Thats what recruiters agency does. People who applies to your job are those who knows you and are willing to work with you. 
Difference is same what applies in outbound marketing and inbound marketing.
Yes, either way you get a candidate, it gonna solves a long term problem.

[22/06/18, 12:30:49 AM] Amit Rohra (ps): Looking forward to engaging with and contributing to the community. I have 20 years of work experience, 10 of which have been in the corporate world, a few years as a restaurateur, a few years remotely consulting with a couple of American SME's & startups, & a few as the founder of Peepin. That's the quick lowdown. I have experience with a gamut of different industries and roles including ops, HR, Sales & BD, process structuring and re-engineering, work flow automation & B2B digital marketing. If I can help anyone in anyway, please feel free to reach out.🙏

[22/06/18, 5:23:40 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Hello guys Harshal Shroff here, After running and exiting my operations of 18 outlets and retaining the brand of This Corn,I visited my home town(Chinchani in Palaghar district) after 8yrs of living in Mumbai, I see that not much has changed here apart from the fact that people consume more data(Due to JIO and the current data based marketing) on their phone and are slowly getting aware about "The power of internet and connected lives" it's more like electricity, which still has power cuts in many rural areas. It's been a overwhelming experience of starting up once and humbling to exit and start once again.

However, Schools and bussiness dont see the value of data connections, and even if they do.. complete connectivity becomes an issue due to unstable Network performance.

In the comming one month i am LOOKING to connect and speak with people interested to build multilingual and affordable ways to bring 4G/5G broadband and connect applications to Rural India with "wireless street level WIFI connectivity, based on renewable POWER solutions to effective ways to deliver digital access to people with incomes less than 10k/month

If you are interested or are connected to people/startups who focus on this area do help me connect, we are also looking to connect with affordable Telecom equipment manufacturers and Network infrastructure creators.

Ideally ex-employees of companies like Telenor india, Storeking,Airjaldi,Aervoyce, Wifi Dababa, Digital empowerment foundation or people in the government helping digital india movement in the RURAL areas

Currently we are preparing to build an application for applying for a CLASS A or a Unified, Virtual Network Operator (VNO) licence.

Our Aim is to build
-Robust cheap wireless street level connectivity infrastructure
-Delivering NEW experiences and products to Rural India in affordable ways
- Delivering sachet(Under 50INR) size data,learning,insurance and investment solutions.

If your a passionate problem solver and internet enthusiast and would like to contribute to the iniative, in your free time which may lead to a full blown position..feel free to join the group. Here -- https://chat.whatsapp.com/CXRDhMeMy2i2HSSzh1reUd

[24/06/18, 7:31:40 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: http://www.thehindu.com/business/cas-excluded-from-fair-valuation-of-start-ups/article24007644.ece
[24/06/18, 7:32:23 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: Can someone explain, what will be the effect of this new rule ?
[24/06/18, 8:56:59 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Yea
[24/06/18, 8:57:17 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Guys, I think this is important.
[24/06/18, 8:59:21 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Every time your company needs a valutation (mostly while raising funds), a CA issues a valuation certificate which is then provided to the IT department.
This is what was happening till now.
But, according to this rule, for someone to issue a valuation certificate, a CA certification is not enough.
You need to be a merchant banker.
[24/06/18, 9:18:18 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: But then in this case the fee will be higher and also valuation will be what a merchant banker will decide, if there is an agreement between me and my investor whatever value we decide, but now we will be not allow to do that, because of this rule, and it be the end startup ecosystem in India, because everyone is not Ambani, adani who can run company on his own, or have assets and contacts in bank to get huge loans.
[24/06/18, 9:22:41 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: What if I register my company offshore like Singapore then these idiotic rules no longer apply, thats what flipkart did 🤣
[24/06/18, 10:01:30 PM] Nikhil Sacheva (ps): They did after they got initial round of funding and they were doing well. Its not feasible for a budding startup to bear offshore costs
[24/06/18, 10:01:34 PM] Nikhil Sacheva (ps): :/
[24/06/18, 10:02:00 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): True
[24/06/18, 10:02:31 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: I know, so it means only ambani. Adani can do business in India.
[24/06/18, 10:04:57 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): No.. anyone can.. I don't want to initiate a debate.. i myself lead a financial services global firm & this ruling directly hits my current account but isn't an impediment to grow & prosper
[24/06/18, 10:06:14 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Investment isn't the only or that critical a factor to grow in initial stages.. once u grow.. merchant banker or a ca firm hardly matters
[24/06/18, 10:07:32 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: Investment matters mostly intial stages, if startup is not  able to raise funds initially it will shut down
[24/06/18, 10:07:47 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: Tech and innovative startup will get affected
[24/06/18, 10:07:53 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): I might be wrong in a few cases/scenarios.. but in a larger scheme of things it just strikes off a product off my offerings list.. that's it
[24/06/18, 10:07:55 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): #personalOpinion
[24/06/18, 10:08:06 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: Because a tech product requires lot of initial investment
[24/06/18, 10:08:26 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Okay.. didn't know that.. 😊
[24/06/18, 10:08:40 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: What was your firm again ?
[24/06/18, 10:09:04 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): A financial services firm.
[24/06/18, 10:09:54 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: Ok, I can easily afford CA and lawyers but go and afford a single techie

[24/06/18, 10:10:15 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: And a tech product requires a team of techies
[24/06/18, 10:10:35 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: So, in this case no innovation will happen
[24/06/18, 10:10:44 PM] ‪+91 99909 66887‬: In India like it did in valley

[26/06/18, 11:56:13 AM] Bits Spark: Hey, a general suggestion 

If you're looking for a connect (especially with someone difficult to reach) please be specific about your reason and the context. 

If you cannot be bothered to write down why and what you want, why should anyone on the community take out the time to connect you and ask someone for their time? 

This is more important with people who are difficult to reach, but should be extended as a general courtesy.

[26/06/18, 12:09:47 PM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): Have you tried connecting with them through LinkedIn? There is a career guidance option on LinkedIn where you can Inmail people who are open to provide guidance regarding particular topics
[26/06/18, 12:12:18 PM] Hardik Solanki (pushstart): Yes but i need to meet them personally... as their are various question that i need answers... its my ground work

[26/06/18, 12:17:56 PM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): Buddy, as a marketing guy you need to put in efforts to talk to n number of people before you land a few minutes of AIMS doctor time. 


Inmail them, ask for a email or number, break down your questionnaire into sub topics, if it's general things, try to get them answered over email mostly, set up a meeting with them, and then create a rewarding experience for them too
[26/06/18, 12:20:03 PM] Hardik Solanki (pushstart): I tried bro...

[26/06/18, 4:41:18 PM] Nikita (pushstart): Umm not really... if you love sales, you’ll perform well and earn well.. 
targets are not unrealistic, it’s just,  how well you can perform and manage your targets..

[28/06/18, 7:45:13 PM] PG: Hey guys, 

1) In our quest to bring MSME online, we have done a low budget website for a travel company. Travelopedia.in
We request you share your valuable feedback keeping in mind that few things couldn't be done cause of budget constraints. 

2) I'm writing a white paper on luxury marketing. Do you think that I should have a section on local language marketing (which very few brands adapt to)?

[28/06/18, 10:33:28 PM] Mohit Madam (ethx): I think this would not only save electricity(which miners consume in Gigawatts) but wouldalso help them scale

[28/06/18, 10:37:13 PM] Mohit Madam (ethx): I think it would move to PoS and if a large chunk of community is against it, we might see a split in chain.
[28/06/18, 10:37:32 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Another fork :3
[28/06/18, 10:38:05 PM] Mohit Madam (ethx): Yes, all we need to see is whether it would be a soft or hard fork

[30/06/18, 9:51:53 AM] Neeraj Joshi: [Long Read] - Invite for Social Samosa's LIVE Conference

The team at Social Samosa is excited to pay a tribute to the medium which is a driving factor for the evolution, existence and sustenance of quite a lot of Brands, Agencies, Publishers, Platforms, and Creators!

When we set out to recreate the #SMLive Magic this year, I was told 8 Million People and 2 Lac+ Video Views were possible in 2017 and it's a tough nut to crack considering the friendly NewsFeed algorithm.

As ambitious as it may sound, riding high in the faith and power of our community of Marketers, Agency Professionals, Creators, and Practitioner we are all set to take the challenge and breach the circles of virality with #SMLive2018

We plan to kick-start the day with a Keynote Address from one of the pioneers in Indian Advertising and Marketing Industry - Mr. Ashish Bhasin

Taking the baton from him C-Suite Advisor and Power Influencer - Tanvi Gautam will take us through the essentials of Building an Authentic Personal Brand on Social Media

Anoushka Adya, Rashi Ray and Mounica Tata DoodleODrama will discuss on how Social Media has emerged as a great tool to enable Women Empowerment

This is just the beginning; next up we have Kainaz Karmakar  and Harshad Rajadhyaksha from the team which managed to win Ogilvy India's first CANNES Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness this year with Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks. They will speak about the LITTLE they know about Great Advertising!

A lot has been spoken about the various applications of Data across, Ashish Tiwari will share a different perspective on Data-Driven Storytelling to craft the right message

Chandramohan Mehra from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will bring in the flavor of Hyper Current and Topical Content with anecdotes from their collaboration with Dabbu The Dancer aka The Dancing Uncle

Threading thoughts from being responsive and customer-centric at all points in time, Vineet Singh will share Quick Social CRM Hacks to win over audiences

Mr. Bean from the Indian Digital Industry, Nitin Bhatia will enunciate the importance and relevance of Data in the value chain

Shifting Gear towards some Creator Tales, Ranveer Allahbadia - The Beer Biceps will share his story on carving a niche amongst the content clutter

The Master Storyteller behind some of the most engaging original content from Kingfisher, Sandeep Balan will draw parallels between Branded Content and Original Content

Over the past few years, Wittyfeed has become one of the largest Viral Content Companies and Parveen Singhal will share Growth Hacking Lessons in the process of building this new age company

Nidhi Bisht and Sarjita Jain from India's Leading Women Content Channel will sum up the #SMLive2018 show with a talk on Creating Entertainment for Women with Brands

That's the amazing lineup we have been talking about ever since we launched the initiative this year; as we strive to raise the bar and make this BIGGER & BETTER we are counting on your support to make this happen!

Come and join us to Celebrate #WorldSocialMedia Day

- Show Interest/Attendance to the event here bit.ly/SMLive2018

[04/07/18, 12:56:36 AM] Aayush (Pushstart): Hi guys,
One of my friend did an Internship in a startup who promised ₹15000 for android development.

After completion of work the company is telling that they will pay only after app gets pushed on app store (which has uncertain timelines).

The company has signed a proper offer letter with the intern.

What do you suggest to do in this case?
[04/07/18, 12:57:05 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @919937536453
[04/07/18, 12:57:32 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Does this offer letter say that the payment would be made on delivery basis?
[04/07/18, 12:57:54 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): If not, we can take this up on social media and send them a  legal notice as well
[04/07/18, 12:59:44 AM] Aayush (Pushstart): Its not mentioned on the letter.
[04/07/18, 1:00:44 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): So ask him to send them a lovely message stating that a lawyer will be hired in case they don't release the money.
[04/07/18, 1:01:35 AM] Aayush (Pushstart): Sounds cool.
[04/07/18, 1:01:54 AM] Aayush (Pushstart): Does any govt org protect the interest of interns?
[04/07/18, 1:02:26 AM] Vikram Taneja (ps): A lawyer will take 15k to send a legal notice these days .
[04/07/18, 1:02:26 AM] Bits Spark: Yes, they do. Right after they protect the rights of regular workers.
[04/07/18, 1:02:45 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): I have lawyers who do it for 1k
[04/07/18, 1:02:47 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): 😂
[04/07/18, 1:02:53 AM] Vikram Taneja (ps): 👍👍
[04/07/18, 1:02:58 AM] Aayush (Pushstart): Please pm contacts
[04/07/18, 1:03:03 AM] Vikram Taneja (ps): But that's only the beginning
[04/07/18, 1:03:06 AM] Bits Spark: Yup, that's usually the cost.
[04/07/18, 1:03:54 AM] Vikram Taneja (ps): I am not discouraging but going beyond a legal notice is very cumbersome
[04/07/18, 1:04:02 AM] Vikram Taneja (ps): And expensive
[04/07/18, 1:04:55 AM] Priyal Anand (ps): Being a lawyer....I guess no lawyer has been worked for 1k where the cost affidavit and doing notary incurred the cost above of 1k
[04/07/18, 1:04:55 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): 60% of the cases are resolved by legal notices
[04/07/18, 1:05:16 AM] Vikram Taneja (ps): Better is mutual resolved between parties..and even on social media
[04/07/18, 1:05:25 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Notary and affidavit ?
[04/07/18, 1:05:48 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): So you are suggesting that a legal notice can't be sent at 1k?
[04/07/18, 1:06:12 AM] Priyal Anand (ps): Offcourse
[04/07/18, 1:06:23 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): ..:)
[04/07/18, 1:06:55 AM] Priyal Anand (ps): Can you please identify what kind of legal notice can be draft and then sent under the mentioned amount
[04/07/18, 1:07:21 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Let's take this discussion to personal messages of Fb
[04/07/18, 1:07:26 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): This will bug people
[04/07/18, 1:08:20 AM] Priyal Anand (ps): Not intrested sir ....
But i was just clarfying that in our fraternity it cant be assemble liked this
Thanks
[04/07/18, 1:09:11 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): No worries.

I think we have tools to send bulk messages viz. 'whatsappbulksender' but not viceversa

Can you please shed some light?

[06/07/18, 5:06:31 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): In context to Whatsapp group.

What are the pros and what are the cons?
[06/07/18, 5:06:47 PM] ‎You changed this group's settings to allow only admins to send messages to this group.

[06/07/18, 5:08:01 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Thanks.
[06/07/18, 5:09:30 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I think it will act more like a broadcast list/platform with one way communication. I think the next feature would be to make it more personalised based on user profiles
[06/07/18, 5:09:54 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): So list building on whatsapp can be done right?
[06/07/18, 5:10:00 PM] Batman (pushstart): suggestion: move from WA to Telegram or Slack. Can do a lot of focussed and meaningful discussions

Just think what will happen when India's entrepreneurial innovators can create great global companies without leaving their country. They will change the world. Hundreds of large firms focused on the Internet will be founded and will succeed by focusing purely on Indian consumers, Indian taste, and Indian style, and one of them can ultimately become the next Google. Bring it on!

[26/07/18, 4:40:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: #PushUpdate #PushAMA #PushLaunch 
Our first Product Launch+AMA on Pushstart by founder of Wild Earth. 

Ask her anything and everything related to her journey and brand Wild Earth <3 <3 

Shabia Ravi Walia, Founder and Owner of 'Wild Earth' is a media professional for the past 24 years.﻿ 

'Wild Earth' was born out of Shabia's fears of what she put on her baby's body after she became a mother. 

The labels scared her and the fact that she did not understand what went into the products made her uncomfortable. 

Being the solution driven person she is, Shabia started making soaps and lotions in her own kitchen.  

Soon word spread and mothers were demanding her to make the full range. Her experiments proved to be a huge hit with everyone and soon she was forced to move from her kitchen to a proper office and workshop

Today Shabia is proud to have created a brand that provides natural quality products which young, old and babies can use without any fear of side effects of harsh chemicals.

'Wild Earth' today sells online, thru retail stores, is a huge gifting opting for corporates and is exported to quite a few foreign countries, purely on the basis of its quality and the pure intention behind the brand, an intention that was born from a mothers heart and not in a business school.

[01/08/18, 2:47:51 PM] Priyanka Deo (ps): Hey Everyone: When I was studying in the US and wanted to be informed of Indian news- I found the experience very frustrating. EVERY platform seemed to be slanted. My dream was to create a neutral platform where people could be honest and unafraid to talk about issues. Hence - NIJ was created. I am currently looking to start an active community that can give inputs and start conversation about topics in an intellectual and intelligent manner. This community would also act as a board of advisors on what content our team should and could possibly put out for everyone.

With the rise of Chinese #TechnoNationalism it will be interesting to see whether such a frenzied push will result in the desired sustained levels of innovation, or prove to be just a short-lived gold rush. Your opinion matters.

Folks, I'm Mithun. I hail from Mumbai (Bombay for the old school romantics) and Head Community Building at 91springboard. We're a coworking space, that's focused on building communities that help businesses and people learn and grow. I'm sure some 91soringboarders (current & ex, are already partners of this group). I'm currently in Delhi and will be around for the next couple of weeks.

In between the reviews and ratings, I am searching some case studies where I someone got helped in such a way that it was huge in his or her perspective. Like i have seen so many people getting jobs because of Pushstart, legal or accounting help and so on. 

One more thing. So many people are inactive and are somewhere at a stage they are about to start. I think you should start coming to PushMeetups too, that really helped me. 

I got some amazing tips before execution of my startup Groomers from people like Nitin Sethi Sir and Amit Rohra Sir. It really helped. What about your views on Pushmeetups guys??

[05/08/18, 6:27:56 PM] PG: #Suggestion required. 

We our a young and boutique agency. Our services, primarily, can be categorized into four segments:

Branding Services

Web Development and SEO

Digital Marketing

Digital PR

It has been 15 months. We are growing steadily. Served quite a number of clients including three big brands and many young brands. Now we wish to grow exponentially. For this, what should be a good plan for marketing and lead generation for an agency. Digital has been not giving a very good results. 
For example we did a campaign for CEO/Founder/Owner on FB. 17 out first 25 leads were like CEO of Jaat Parivar and similar non-relevant leads. LinkedIn is too expensive. More importantly, people still prefer references from friends and family. 

Note: More than corporates, we wish to work in a promoter based system with MSME. 

Any suggestions from veterans and experienced will be really appreciated.
[05/08/18, 6:37:18 PM] Vipul Gupta (ps): Nothing works better than sincerity and hard work.. Initially you face some resistance but genuine service providers always win ... My experience with you has not been pleasant but still I believe genuinuity is the biggest brand tag and Sincerity the biggest USP...!!

AMA: All of us have constant questions about the deep (dark?) world of VC funding or investments in general across different levels (Seed to Growth). 

Today, as discussed with Neeraj Joshi, I am doing an AMA to answer any of your queries in and around this topic. 

About me: I have been a global investor and a serial entrepreneur, with multiple successful exits and investments across countries, using my roles as founder of a VC firm while being Advisor to a number of others. 

I take pride in building multi-million dollar companies, Great Manager Institute being the recent one. I run quite a few companies in different geographies. 

I am NOT an expert. I am just a learner and a perennial student.

Apne aap ko introduce kara ki debit card service center se bol raha hu...immediately i understood he is a fraud, so i started asking him random questions and he disconnected. 

Beware of such calls, they will brainwash you to get your card details and then make a transaction from your bank account. Kabhi bhi kisi ko bhi apna pin and otp share nahi karne ka. 

Now how can we make his life hell taaki kisi ka nuksaan hone se bach jaaye? Should we start spam calling him?

Glad to see such high activity in this group.

We are now based out of Palo Alto, USA. We started off from Gurgaon, India, last year. Currently, we are active in 5 global tech ecosystems; US(SF, NY, Austin), EU(London) SAE(Singapore), ME(Dubai), India.

We train & certify PM/aspiring PM professionals with 4+ yrs of work experience via 120 hrs of live sessions in a compact 12 week alt MBA course, conduct remote product development and shipping with our world class distributed Design& Tech teams during the course and offer placement programs globally, at the end of the course. 

More can be shared on Direct Message(DM).

Look forward to connect with you all and help build a better product ecosystem.

Poster: https://facebook.com/startupfellowship.org
[09/08/18, 10:34:11 AM] Ashutosh Kumar (pushstart): Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified the amended Section 42 and its corresponding Rule No. 14 of the Companies Act, 2013 with effect from August 07, 2018. 

 
Please find herewith the broad changes made in the revised section 42 and its corresponding rules:

(a) Deletion of requirement w.r.t. value of offer or invitation per person: The requirement of the value of offer or invitation per person of INR 20,000/- of face value of the securities has been done away with.

(b) Usage of Share Application Money: Now a company is not permitted to utilize the share application money received by it unless (i) allotment is made; and (ii) the return of allotment, in e-form PAS – 3, is filed with the Registrar of Companies.

(c) Reduction in time period for filing e-form PAS – 3: Now, a company is required to file the return of allotment within 15 days of allotment instead of 30 days.

(d) Separate penal provisions for non-filing of e-form PAS – 3:  Where a company defaults in filing e-form PAS – 3 within 15 days of allotment, the company, its promoters and directors shall be liable with a penalty INR 1,000/- per day but not exceeding INR 25,00,000/-.

(e) Common private placement offer cum application form: The form PAS-4 has been revised and has a small section of application letter that needs to be filed in by the applicant. This application needs to be submitted by the applicant along with subscription money paid either by cheque, demand draft or other banking channel and not by cash.

(f) Fresh offer prior to allotment: Earlier there was a restriction that no fresh offer or invitation can be made unless the allotment w.r.t. any earlier offer has been completed or the offer has been withdrawn or abandoned. Now a carve out has been provided that where he number of persons to whom the offer is made does not exceed 200, the company may, at any time, make more than one issue of securities to such class of identified persons.

 (g) Restriction on rights of renunciation: The revised section specifically restricts any right of renunciation of the private placement offer that is been made by the issuer company. The earlier section and rules did not have the said restriction.

 (h) Revision of penalty amount: The penal provision has been revised from ‘the amount involved in the offer or invitation or Rupees Two Crore, whichever is higher” to ‘the amount involved in the offer or invitation or Rupees Two Crore, whichever is lower”.

Please find herewith the links to the commencement notification and the revised rules:

[15/08/18, 6:55:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi All! Posting on behalf of The Goa Project (TGP).

The Goa Project is an annual “unconference” that brings together a diverse set of people from various fields – to converse, collaborate and co-create. The entire agenda is crowdsourced, leading to two exciting days of talks, workshops, presentations, pitches and interventions. Run completely by volunteers who are passionate about cross-sector learning, collaboration and ideas.

The sixth edition of TGP will happen on the 26-27th of Oct at a secret location that's NOT Goa! Yes you heard that right. We're also launching a week long (19-25th Oct, 2018) fully-funded TGP Residency where business owners, makers, thinkers, do-ers will be matched with inter-disciplinary collaborators bringing in an opportunity for both venture owners & collaborators to work on innovative solutions! 

This is where you come in! TGP is looking to reach out to exceptional venture-owners who will bring interesting flavors to the residency (they're also looking to find equally interesting collaborators, but more on that on a later date) and for this, included below are the application and more information links. We urge you to apply right away (deadline is 18th Aug), if you know someone who could benefit from this too, do spread the word to them as well!

Application link:  https://goo.gl/forms/ebqciZ1NTJf3oasZ2
More details on the residency: http://www.thegoaproject.com/eligibility-criteria/ 
FAQs: http://www.thegoaproject.com/faqs/ 

If you think you'd make an awesome volunteer instead, apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/ZpBmUvsQYv4IGQ8F2 

Appreciate the help!
Thanks!

[16/08/18, 5:56:43 PM] Gitanjali (ps): This startup is on main news of YourStory. I am happy for them but wondering why is a business that makes websites for clients is called Startup🤔
Isn't startup something to do with innovation. 

Why is every business these days branded as startup. I met a woman who takes sarees from wholesellers and sells through fb & whatsapp, calling herself startup.

Your thoughts?
[16/08/18, 5:56:58 PM] Gitanjali (ps): https://yourstory.com/2018/08/18-year-old-coder-launches-startup-rs-5000-reports-revenues-rs-1-crore-3-years/amp
[16/08/18, 6:01:03 PM] Kanika Modi (pushstart): Unfortunately not.
[16/08/18, 6:01:11 PM] Ayush Garg (ps): Totally on point. 

Startups are innovation driven, at core. But like everything else that gets accepted/validated/adopted, it's been overtaken by the likes of above.
[16/08/18, 6:18:13 PM] Harish Venkatesh (ps): I guess it’s basically the difference in understanding of what the word ‘Startup’ actually means and what it is perceived as. 

Don’t necessarily agree with @918919497643 point on Startups should be _innovation_ driven. Too abstract. Every creation is an innovation. We can’t simply claim that you have to innovate to be a Startup. The markets do need run-of-the-mill companies that helps others drive innovation and make this effective in Operarions, cost, etc. blah blah.
[16/08/18, 6:32:34 PM] Neeraj Joshi: There is not as such universally accepted definition of a startup. You can frame the one who like and others talk about :)
[16/08/18, 6:32:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *no
[16/08/18, 6:32:54 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *you
[16/08/18, 6:35:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Startup is the buzz word these days so every company would want to leverage that. Youth connects with the word startup more than the word business.
[16/08/18, 6:35:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Tg of yourstory are youths. Tg above 50y hota toh they would have used the word business 😏😏
[16/08/18, 6:36:13 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): By innovation, Ayush didn't mean that the product should be out of the box.
Even if you are making the process robust and bringing in performance, you are innovating..:)
[16/08/18, 6:36:43 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Precisely. And innovation isnt limited to startups, but even businesses need to innovate!
[16/08/18, 6:38:29 PM] Harish Venkatesh (ps): Yup. Agreed. Just throwing in thoughts on the perception of what innovation and startup is. Reframing what you said neatly, every creation has an aspect of innovation by default in it.

Please let me know if you come across any such opportunities. My number is 7722086168, what's a good day and time to chat to discuss this in more detail?



Best,

Yan

[17/08/18, 10:00:42 PM] Priyanka Deo (ps): If interested or know anyone interested in speaking- here are the prompts:
[17/08/18, 10:01:12 PM] Priyanka Deo (ps): Speaker Prompt
There are several ways to go about it. Your 4-7 minute monologue must have personal insights and also tie in your story as an entrepreneur/professional/student in India. 

We will have a small intro which I will compile & finalize with you tomorrow. This intro will be read right before you speak, so you don't need to include this in your 4-7 minutes.

Remember, it is open mic which is way more casual than a formal speech- so have fun with it! The people want to know about you and your story :)  

Write your monologue around the following topics: 

1. Just a few years ago, being an entrepreneur was a term that was not something to be proud of in India. Now the term is lauded. How has this helped you evolve as an entrepreneur? 
2. How do you handle your personal/professional life? What is the hardest part and how do you deal with it?
3. Many government efforts now push for entrepreneurship which carry the mantra, 'why take jobs when you can create jobs?' How do you fit into this energy? 
4. What is the biggest struggle you have faced in your professional life and how have you overcome it? 
5. Now, there are many efforts that India is making to finance and support entrepreneurs. How have you leveraged that with your company?
[17/08/18, 10:01:40 PM] Priyanka Deo (ps): 6. What is the biggest struggle you have faced as a female entrepreneur/professional? How have you overcome it?
[17/08/18, 10:12:00 PM] ‪+91 99785 38243‬: Finally done filling the introduction form.😋

[17/08/18, 11:05:01 PM] Ridhima (ps): Kerala is being ravaged by unprecedented torrential rains leading to an extremely grave situation of flood spread across 14 districts. More than 2 lakh people have been displaced with a death-toll of 324. Doctors in the state have already started working double-shifts. As per WHO, the aftermath of floods usually see an increase in water-borne and vector-borne diseases. An estimated 4 lakh patients would require medical consultations in the next few weeks. To assist with this exponential demand, we are planning to set up a basic website where patients can seek free medical advice. For this, we are looking for the following who can give time pro-bono : 1) Qualified doctors, 2) Volunteers who speak Malayalam, 3) Developers who can help set up the technology.

3 Questions i have sorry. 
1. Being a blogger and seo guy we teach people to start with niche specific blogs only.
Writing about everything under the sun, what are the pros and cons you ever felt.
2. What are monetization methods you use for wittyfeed and any hidden methods or streams you use that we miss out or newly invented. Curious! 😍
3. Being a successful company owner, what are the things you feel you are still missing out to become a monopoly in market for content business.

Would appreciate your generous answers on them if questions seems eligible.
Would be interested in meeting you soon for our event DMconference we do.
(Sorry if I missed any group rules Nikunj)

I, with a few other young folks have started Young India Foundation - to empower young people to enter governance! 

Young India Foundation is India's first youth-led political-action committee and advocacy group 

We're looking for young people to get involved in the organisation and join a voluntary team of Indian students and young people from Oxford, Stanford, Harvard, and NYU to help build a better and younger India.

Currently, looking out for a AV editor (to help develop videos/infographics) AND Website developer URGENTLY - as a part of the YIF Engineering team.

Check us out on www.youngindia.foundation 

Any leads, from any city in India, are welcome!
[24/08/18, 7:13:35 PM] Sayan Ganguly: How can we associate from our city ?
[24/08/18, 7:13:45 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Would love to bring YIF to my city
[24/08/18, 7:14:28 PM] Ridhima (ps): Which city are you from?
[24/08/18, 7:14:34 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Visakhapatnam
[24/08/18, 7:15:44 PM] Sayan Ganguly: We have currently raw political fandom here rather than a sorted advocacy group
[24/08/18, 7:55:51 PM] Gitanjali (ps): I will come. What time is your panel
[24/08/18, 8:15:02 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Ridhima sounds Interesting ! 

All the best to your journey ! I'm more than happy to discuss via PM, If that's okay with you.

About me: Served the board of founders team in commonfloor. Presently the ED at BookBySlot and Operational Director at Settlrs. Also a fund raiser at a prominent VC firm in mumbai.

I have always believed that the nation cannot be changed at the backstage. The youth needs to enter into politics to make a significant change.
[24/08/18, 8:16:30 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Dm me if you need help. :)
[24/08/18, 8:17:02 PM] Sayan Ganguly: At least with CII we can sort commercial politics
[24/08/18, 8:17:28 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): True
[24/08/18, 8:19:15 PM] Ridhima (ps): Thank you all for such enthusiasm. I am humbled. I believe collectively we can achieve something good here!
[24/08/18, 8:19:26 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Youth can connect modernity for any policy research and bring in any creativity, to be taken up by industry bodies and other institutions. If we are very well connected to our Local MP we can get them introduce Private Bills
[24/08/18, 8:19:54 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Being an AIESECer earlier I have seen what Youth can do
[24/08/18, 8:20:22 PM] Ridhima (ps): Well said.
[24/08/18, 8:23:22 PM] Sayan Ganguly: And, also, without having these experiences, network, it is going to be like keeping more in the mouth than the youth can chew if he/she joins politics.
[24/08/18, 8:27:57 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Here in AP, we see the youth joining groups of different political parties and then they appear to be blank about how serious challenges can actually be solved. All they know is, their newcomer leader will solve everything. Such bodies are actually trying to change this.

[25/08/18, 2:02:42 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Life is at an halt in the state of Kerala, due to heavy rainfall and opening of almost 35 dams. According to the Government records, 324 deaths and 223139 people have gone homeless and admitted in 1500+ relief camps. Sources say that Kerala is facing its worst floods in 100 years. 

Where will these people go? 

The students of Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth, have come up with an initiative in order to provide them with the basic means to live including food, clothing, shelter and rehabilitation.
The major goal of this initiative is to support those people who are affected by the floods, in whatever way possible. As we are in the affected areas (Ernakulam, Kerala) , we are able to feel the necessity for a plan of action or an initiative to help and serve our people. 
We have started an online campaign in order to raise fund --

https://www.bitgiving.com/savekeralasavepeople

And, we have raised almost 8.2 Lakh in 4 days. Almost, 132 families were provided with basic requirements for their meal and stay. Groceries, utensils, medicines, toiletries and 2 sets of dress including undergarments, Sanitary Napkins. 
Recently, when we visited the relief camps, we found the scale of huge destruction: houses have turned into piled bricks, roads are broken, mud is there everywhere. It has been noticed that there has been a stark increase in the number of air and vector-borne diseases. 
For instance, in a camp in Arakkunam, there were 16 pregnant ladies who were stranded without proper food, care and nursing. After three days, they got the doctor after a series of rejection by multiple doctors.
This made us ask the question: What can we do to help the homeless pregnant ladies and Keralites at large? Is 8 lakh enough to serve the people around us? 

The blunt answer is NO. 

It isn't enough. It Isn't enough to even help one family cover their rehabilitation.
Hence, we are asking for more funds. To make the process transparent, we will have a sheet where we calculate each and every expense we incur. 

Service before self is our motto. Humanity our religion.
Please support Kerala. Rebuild Kerala.

Hello Pushstarters, can anybody suggest me any online tool which i can use to extract email from linkedin? need something where i can just put the name of any company and tool can give me emails of decision makers. 

Connect and hunter tool wont work out in this case, because list is long (2k-3k companies) and these 2 tools help extract email one by one

Repeating what exactly? There was a conversation that followed through which obviously involved more people than just me. Moreover I get how this is more of an official thing but it's not like I sent something explicit. I took it off when I was told to do so hence I feel this was uncalled for. Thank you too.

[31/08/18, 10:18:25 PM] Gitanjali (ps): Looking for advice. How important is a product manager/UI expert for a startup to be taken in exchange of equity. 
How to think about it? How much equity to give? Any inputs to clarify this situation will be of great help.
[31/08/18, 10:19:56 PM] Neeraj Kumar (ps): It totally depends upon the type of business model and work
[31/08/18, 10:21:18 PM] Neeraj Kumar (ps): Like if its a software product (not that complex) for which resources are easily available then will suggest you to hire people and don't dissolve equity
[31/08/18, 10:23:24 PM] Neeraj Kumar (ps): Further if the development is complex and the cost for product dev. is too high (needs continous upgrades) then you can think for long term partner with equity sharing, who can take care of the tech side!
[31/08/18, 10:26:02 PM] Neeraj Kumar (ps): Talking about how much equity?
Then it also depends at which stage the startup is like if its idea phase or in early phase then you can go upto 50% (in case 2 partners only) otherwise if startup has already made a name in market then you can negotiate accordingly
[31/08/18, 10:26:31 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Product manager and UI expert can't be used with a /
They r teo different roles. If it's a tech product you definitely would need a product mgr for longer term. Might outsource or hire the UI  guy
[31/08/18, 10:29:13 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Exactly
[31/08/18, 10:53:11 PM] ‪+91 96324 44388‬: Gitanjali,  you are mixing 2 different things.  If your core business is driven by the tech product then you need someone who is domain experts n capable enough to drive your product roadmap to meet the business outcomes. In your case he/she can be name as product manager. 
Now the second thing is compensation or value of his/her time in return. That you need to decide based on the individual how you can keep him/her motivated to go extra miles to achieve the business goals. So,  tech driven businesses go with equity option as its   strategically (kind of marriage contract)  fits to them.
[31/08/18, 10:57:46 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): It very much depends on your product.
One of my friends here in Bangalore made his place as a product manager in a company after a couple of meetings, worked on the product and the company gave him Esops later.
Are we speaking of something like this?
[31/08/18, 11:15:07 PM] PG: I can help with this
[31/08/18, 11:15:21 PM] PG: As in I can connect
[31/08/18, 11:34:56 PM] Pulkit Bhatia (ps): Thnx.sent 
you a PM
[01/09/18, 1:59:22 AM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): I feel PM/UI expert are both over-rated. You have to be both when you start your own. And don't get me wrong, I was a PM myself.. but in startup world it is just customer feedback that you weave back in your product. Hand out a solid equity (10%-49%) to a senior 'full-stack developer' and get your product developed to the market fit.
[01/09/18, 2:22:29 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Lol I would disagree here, PM and UI are one of the most important parts of a team, it's plus point when your UI UX guy knows PM, and it happens alot of time!
When you are building a saas people will use your platform over  mine bcz your is easy to use and solves same problem.
Your developer will make a jugad UI that won't end look good, and I run an agency too and I fight with my devs because they do and they will fuck up UI, there is a learning process where your full stack developer becomes a design centric FSD.
[01/09/18, 2:22:59 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Even look*
[01/09/18, 10:01:20 AM] Gitanjali (ps): Woah! Interesting and conflicting opinions. My confusion deepens further. Esops is a good idea. I need tp explore that more. 
Mine is not tech heavy. It is a B2C platform in health education
[01/09/18, 10:19:17 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Let me jump in here now, I have been reading all messages, PM is a good role in a company trying to scale up, they have an understanding of how product works and what a product is all about but then in a startup founders play the role well and manage the team and development efforts, UI/UX freelancer helps a lot, especially in a B2C product as devs are not design experts, I have seen loads of start-ups fail at this point, never compromise on the design part. What you essentially need is a product designer, someone who can design the product in terms of customer value proposition, user flow, innovative design, UI/UX, architecture etc. That is the kind of person who is a strong team member you need.
[01/09/18, 10:20:08 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Esops is a grey area in india, often bending towards illegal. Don't offer equity as it's never gonna help
[01/09/18, 10:20:24 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Rather hire them on a hourly consultation basis
[01/09/18, 10:20:40 AM] Gitanjali (ps): Hmm
[01/09/18, 10:21:27 AM] Gitanjali (ps): Why equity won't help? Can you pls explain the challenges. So that i know better when negotiating
[01/09/18, 10:25:00 AM] Arbab (pushstart): Not to forget each and every succesful or unicorn have great Product and UI as well
[01/09/18, 10:25:31 AM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): You can have a Product Manager on equity basis and let him handle the UI/UX guy (outsourced or hired) while you take care of the business side of it.
[01/09/18, 10:26:23 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Cos there has to be a value of the company and growth projections so that you can match the opportunity cost keeping long term need in mind. 

Let's say they charge 50k a month, that comes to 6L a year, you will have o give equity worth that amount, now let's say they grow and increase the charges by 20% a year, will value of equity also grow ? And what if the equity grows more than that ? Also what if you don't want the association any more ? What if they don't want to associate any more ? If they have equity, they are a director, what other powers do they have ? Are they a risk to you in future ?
[01/09/18, 10:26:37 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): This will help
[01/09/18, 10:45:58 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Id like to weigh in on this, esops are not grey, they are slightly underused. With the ipos coming in indian markets every other week, id be surprised if ppl are start discounting esops. Theres huge difference between an esop vs hourly consultation
[01/09/18, 10:45:59 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): An esop keeps a person invested in tje company for a little long term where buying into the future and vision of the company becomes a consideration. Hourly consultation is friends with benefits to put it mildly.
[01/09/18, 10:46:56 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): So this is also something which cant be shelled out to just about anyone and everyone!
[01/09/18, 10:47:23 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I am not saying they are the same thing or anything but then sometimes you want a FWB not a marriage, keeps it easy to manage
[01/09/18, 10:47:52 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Exactly, thats a choice both parties make!
[01/09/18, 10:48:54 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Secondly cash is always a better incentive than future equity
[01/09/18, 10:51:08 AM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Cannot imagine this coming from you sirji😁
[01/09/18, 10:52:12 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Not for me but it is for most people
[01/09/18, 10:52:34 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): You can hire faster with cash than esops
[01/09/18, 10:58:30 AM] Gitanjali (ps): So this guy had connected with me a year back. Charged a high amount for being hired which I couldn't afford. Now, he comes back with this offer of equity and says he loves my startup idea etc. 
Just to put context to thus discussion.
[01/09/18, 11:02:26 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): DM me ? maybe i can add some more insights
[01/09/18, 11:04:58 AM] Gitanjali (ps): Ok
[01/09/18, 11:40:10 AM] ‪+91 96324 44388‬: Lots of people approach like this. Have a strong evaluation process to see if one fits to carry  the vision of your product/organisation. Team is a strong factor in making any business idea successful. DM me if you are looking for any help.
[01/09/18, 11:52:42 AM] Bits Spark: More 2 cents. 

At an early stage start up, you have 2 kinds of people. 
People who sell stuff
People who build the stuff that you sell (a PM does not build btw, if you're the non tech founder then mktg, product, sales etc if your responsibility. Don't get a new person to do 'product'. 

Unless this person is one of these (and you are the other type) don't waste your breath.
[01/09/18, 11:59:46 AM] Bits Spark: Equity number, depending upon where you are (these are rough guidelines)
1) No product market fit/validation, divide equity equally amongst all
2) No funding but validation/pilot done, double digits equity expected
3) Pre-seed round raised, 4-10%
4) Seed round raised, can still give out common stock (with vesting) but 1-2% (there is a particular way to structure it). Usually give esops. 
5) Series A onwards, esops only
[01/09/18, 12:17:33 PM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): Thanks for this. Some learning for me too.

[03/09/18, 4:00:34 PM] Atul Goyal (ps): Thanks for adding me here Neeraj! Hello folks! I'm Atul. Just to give a brief intro I worked in a payments startup for ~4 years and quit my job two years back to find out my true calling. I'm now building a travel startup called MyWanderlust. Just to give a quick idea, we're trying to solve some of the problems people face with travel research and we're also promoting offbeat tours organized by other travelers and local folks. We have been in public beta for sometime now and I wanted to get in touch with a few folks who are passionate about travel and would like to check out what we're doing and share their inputs. I'd love to walk you through, on call if you can drop me your #. Or you can directly visit MyWanderlust dot in (not directly linking as I'm not sure if that's ok here or not). You won't even need to sign up to check out most of what we're doing. Other than that I would love to connect to some folks who're organizing some trips (treks, road trips, etc?) in case some of you happen to know someone who's doing that. Have a good day y'all!

Do we have a telegram group as well?
[04/09/18, 5:17:59 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Not right now.
Anythign specific that you are looking for?
[04/09/18, 5:18:06 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): *anything
[04/09/18, 5:23:36 PM] PG: Nothing that I look for myself...but for group in entirety.. 

Maybe a bigger group and more networking for all...more privacy, options of time bound chats and messages, large file sharing n much more. That is why most of the groups of A category schools, institutes, And companies prefer telegram. 

That's all...
[04/09/18, 5:24:40 PM] PG: Maybe we can also combine both (or even more) groups there...

A real estate client of mine will open 20 accounts (for different-different projects) in your client's bank and he will be needing 4 machines per account. My client can manage balance of 5 Crore in the current account and if required can allow bank to open 100-110 salaried accounts for their employees.

Ask:- Bank who can commit 4 machines per account + INR 0 MDR rate per transaction.

ICICI is offering 40 paisa/transaction, i got to know from somewhere that yesbank can offer O MDR.

#suggestions
[11/09/18, 10:37:41 AM] ‪+91 94168 49649‬: Ok  cool
It may be possible to raise and depends on VC and type of business. For e.g. some of traditional food franchises has been funded in the past  by the investors
[11/09/18, 10:39:32 AM] PG: No very traditional business like like garment manufacturers, Corrugated box manufacturers, Iran and still traders... Like spicy has nothing unique but have been a consistent performer...
[11/09/18, 10:40:22 AM] PG: **they've nothing unique
[11/09/18, 10:42:09 AM] ‪+91 94168 49649‬: They can definitely able to raise money if they have huge cash flow. Some of export and import merchants can do so that as well
[11/09/18, 10:42:41 AM] ‪+91 94168 49649‬: It need not to be unique but a high cash flow is what required
[11/09/18, 10:45:59 AM] PG: High cash flow is primarily associated with B2C businesses... All these are B2B
[11/09/18, 10:51:57 AM] ‪+91 94168 49649‬: It need not to be B2C. Some of the garment traders  are generating ( for e.g in Karol Bagh) are generating a cash flow of nearly $2m yearly. They are not doing it because they are earning huge margins on sales and they don’t want to involve a VC as a partner
[11/09/18, 11:11:28 AM] Ayush Goyal (ps): Actually I meant this won't work for me
[11/09/18, 11:23:05 AM] Ridhima (ps): Hey everyone, 2 weeks ago I'd talked about this concept and you guys had shared some amazing inputs and a lot of you reached out to assist us. In the meantime, we people were trying to streamline our approach. We're finally done with it and I'd appreciate your inputs once again on the following. 
We feel that the youth is disillusioned by the whole idea of politics but with the correct form of engagement they can be reconnected to the cause. We had a dry run in a village in gurgaon and had success in getting a 24 year old elected in the district elections. This has made us realize that  the youth needs guidance most  of all. I am now trying to devise the best way to get their interest back. One way is to conduct workshops in colleges. So I'd like to know from you people, what do you think should the structure of these workshops be? The duration to the content that should be shared with the youth. I'd love to have inputs on everything from you all. 

Thanks for your time!
[11/09/18, 11:23:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Share on fb group :)
[11/09/18, 11:25:04 AM] Ridhima (ps): 👍
[11/09/18, 11:36:23 AM] Aayush (Pushstart): VCs wont until you show them where you are going to disrupt. Since traditional businesses arent scalable so easily so they wont fund them.
[11/09/18, 11:47:42 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): If you show a good margin, and relatively lower risk, then yes!
[11/09/18, 12:49:44 PM] Atul Goyal (ps): can raise funds? yes. from whom? probably loan from banks and not VCs. contrary to what many said VCs aren't looking for low risk. what they're looking for is a huge opportunity though. chances of that happening in traditional biz is less so VCs usually won't even talk to you unless you can show a huge market. and if it's a traditional biz with potential margin, getting a debt/loan could be even better idea given you retain whole ownership and full control?
[11/09/18, 1:05:45 PM] Nveen (ps): I agree unless the business is unique traditional businesses have a better chance of getting a loan. There are a lot of FinTech companies that give out loans with low interest rates. Unless the idea is disruptive kinda like Wow momos it’s not a viable investment. Again I am not an investor but I am sure maybe some do invest to keep the cash flow going.
[11/09/18, 1:09:54 PM] Bits Spark: Some perspective: 
VCs, Banks, PEs, IBs, Angels, Family offices, pension funds etc are all basically money lenders. 
They are just different in terms of their risk appetite and the consequent payoffs. 

So, a traditional business, with steady cash flows has very limited requirement for equity capital (thats what a VC investment is). Debt capital is significantly cheaper. 

In fact, (after 4 years in the Angel investment business), I have advised many folks looking to start up (build a business) to just get a bank loan. That's how most businesses were built and still are. For eg, while cult.fit had raised their initial round as an equity round (~15mn) they have currently raised a very large debt round.

An analogy all types of funding are basically vehicles with specific characteristics. You wouldn't use a sports car to transport heavy machinery, the same way you won't buy a mini truck to get from the metro to your house. They will all get things from point A to B, albeit in a different manner/for a diff use case.
[11/09/18, 1:11:25 PM] Bits Spark: VC funding is a very specific use case of capital deployment and a really really expensive one

[12/09/18, 10:54:22 PM] Ridhima (ps): Theek*
[12/09/18, 10:55:38 PM] Nitesh Manav (pushstart): Well, simply html based site can be cheaper but if you are serious about your blog section, WordPress would be the most wise and affordable choice. Having said that, don't look for the cheaper stuff as there might be some guy to offer you a WordPress blog in 2K or so.. but beware.. take good care of your blog speed, performance and hosting choice while choosing the chosen one.
[12/09/18, 10:57:02 PM] Nitesh Manav (pushstart): For shared hosting, it's the right charge...but you can get an optimised VPS/cloudhost with much more speed/performance by putting a little more money.
[12/09/18, 10:59:32 PM] Ridhima (ps): This is well put. Thanks, I'll focus on the quality of the blog. That matters more.

[13/09/18, 10:40:37 AM] Ridhima (ps): Hey, i need an easy way to reach out to rural young people to help them join my social venture. A lot of organisations use WhatsApp/SMS/Missed Calls to get people to join, etc. I wanted to see if there was a way to get people to join using WhatsApp messages? Can it be automated, and then automatically added to a broadcast list where we can send info/content, etc? Are there any variations of this? I know that a calling software with missed calls does exist, but that’s not really very user-friendly. Any thoughts/leads?
[13/09/18, 10:41:03 AM] Abhishek (tripvenza): Naveen he is running startup and consult them
[13/09/18, 10:47:07 AM] Nveen (ps): Got it thanks!

[13/09/18, 11:38:25 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Depends on the process of onboarding
[13/09/18, 11:38:31 AM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): Job Opening for Kalaage's social media marketing team. Someone with prior email marketing experience is preferred.

Requirements:
# Candidate must know how important it is to take customer feedback.
# Candidate must know the difference between sending out your message and spamming someone.
# Candidate must know that there should always be an option to opt-out of the email marketing list if the receiver doesn't want to get spammed.

Please let Kalaage know of any reference. 
They need an email marketing guy urgently-
SO THEY WOULD STOP SPAMMING MY EMAIL INBOX.

Context- I have already replied to their emails 3 times stating that I want an exit from their email marketing list. But they don't seem to have any 'reply' option within their company.

Best wishes to Kalaage's Marketing team.
[13/09/18, 11:38:36 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): That toh I don't !
[13/09/18, 11:39:10 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Report to Google

[13/09/18, 11:39:53 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Like my 2 o clock cancelled and I am bored sitting in my room with nothing to do
[13/09/18, 11:39:57 AM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): tried 3 times
[13/09/18, 11:40:13 AM] Tushti (pushstart): Ok lemme ask sumit. He will help.
[13/09/18, 11:40:26 AM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): so I thought I'd better recommend them an email marketing specialist
[13/09/18, 11:40:32 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Can you share his details ? This looks like a fun conversation I can have with them
[13/09/18, 11:40:32 AM] Dipanshu Rawal (ps): thank you

[14/09/18, 4:14:19 AM] ‪+91 94410 48409‬: Hi,

Is anyone here looking to incorporate their Startup into a Private Limited company and is willing to register soon? Well I have a company, Phoenix PathFinders Pvt Ltd, which is 3years old now and  hence you will get ESOP option benefit and I'm looking to sell away the ownership to anyone looking to run their own business.

Please let me know if anyone is interested. I would really appreciate any leads or help of any sort. The reason for selling is I'm going on a sabbatical to pursue higher studies after running a Startup successfully for 4 years now and being an Entrepreneur in the ICT and education domain. The company records are clean. You may reach me on Facebook or whatsapp me at 9441048409.

Cheers!

[29/09/18, 9:07:10 AM] Bits Spark: What does that even mean? 
Human centered design suna tha.

Also, ab design thinking bhi phika pad Gaya? So we need another buzz word?
[29/09/18, 9:09:40 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): So human centric design used psycholinguistics along with emotional empathy and other frameworks
[29/09/18, 9:14:38 AM] Bits Spark: Please english ka prayog karein.
[29/09/18, 9:15:19 AM] Bits Spark: Aur pyscholinguistics HCD mein aaj tak use hote hue nahi dekha, na hi kiya. Kya aap ek use case Bata sakte Hain?
[29/09/18, 11:25:25 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 🔥🔥
[29/09/18, 12:21:38 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I have seen multiple projects where peope have used it as part of communication, just cause you have not seen doesn't mean it doesn't happen
[29/09/18, 12:22:12 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): HCD is used in multiple avenues and scenarios, right from product to marketing to content
[29/09/18, 12:23:57 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Design Thinking is not a buzz word, if it was then you would call agile as buzz word too. They are frameworks people use to create products
[29/09/18, 12:30:38 PM] Bits Spark: Which is why I asked for a simple example, in jargon free english. 

I clearly stated that I haven't used it and neither have I ever heard it being mentioned by any serious practitioner.
[29/09/18, 12:31:56 PM] ‪+91 96465 00758‬: Sharing a case study would be very useful here
[29/09/18, 12:33:02 PM] Bits Spark: Yes, HCD is a toolkit. There was never any question on that. 

I was questioning the rest of the hokum.
[29/09/18, 12:33:22 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Cannot agree more. As it is billed as a tool for innovation and finding creative innovative solution to complex problems. It has gained much appreciation world wide.

On the contrary, same method known as experimental-rational approach  existed long back as well which had the same purpose.

Only the words have changed. From can do to empathize, definition to define etc.

To conclude, it is a good old approach in a new flavour.


Better.
[29/09/18, 12:33:47 PM] Bits Spark: I'm not the one casually throwing it around. You are. Which is what I pointed out. 

'What do you really mean by that?'
[29/09/18, 12:34:53 PM] Bits Spark: Yup. 
Hence my problem with people casually throwing these terms around.
[29/09/18, 12:35:17 PM] Bits Spark: Anyhow, this can all be cleared up with a simple example. 

Please to provide.
[29/09/18, 12:35:23 PM] Bits Spark: @919662915070
[29/09/18, 12:35:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I would agree with it. There is no point in throwing jargons if the crowd cannot understand it.
[29/09/18, 12:36:30 PM] Neeraj Joshi: As a product manager your aim is to build things which users can understand and use rather than complicating things for them
[29/09/18, 12:36:37 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Will share once i get free a bit !
[29/09/18, 12:37:20 PM] Bits Spark: Aye. 

Complicating things is usually a sign of bullshit.
[29/09/18, 12:37:31 PM] Bits Spark: Great, thanks :)
[29/09/18, 12:37:33 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): And ...
[29/09/18, 12:38:05 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): So scientific journals are complex, are they bullshit ?
[29/09/18, 12:39:53 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Complexity is a perception
[29/09/18, 12:40:04 PM] ‪+91 96465 00758‬: Umm no it's not
[29/09/18, 12:40:17 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): How is it not ?
[29/09/18, 12:40:36 PM] Bits Spark: Um, @919662915070, if you have the time to debate this, could you please share the example?
[29/09/18, 12:41:07 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I am out on my phone
[29/09/18, 12:41:20 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): You can be patient I guess
[29/09/18, 12:42:45 PM] Bits Spark: Hahahaha, sure man. I'll wait. Breathlessly.
[29/09/18, 12:43:55 PM] Neeraj Joshi: See. The TG of scientific journals understand the complexity, that’s its not BS. If your TG cannot really understand the complexity, either change ur TG or make it more simpler
[29/09/18, 12:44:10 PM] Neeraj Joshi: That’s why
[29/09/18, 12:44:35 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): So complexity is relative not absolute ? Making it a perception
[29/09/18, 12:44:58 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Please do breathe
[29/09/18, 12:45:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes obviously! Complexity is relative.
[29/09/18, 12:46:55 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): 👆🏽
[29/09/18, 12:47:29 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): So if I say something which you find complicated and you are not my TG, do I need to make it simple ?
[29/09/18, 12:49:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s ur TG? The ones who already know about product? Why would u share ur GYAN with the ones who already know about it?
[29/09/18, 12:50:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Share your Gyan with the ones who have no fucking idea about it but want to learn
[29/09/18, 12:54:40 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I am not sharing Gyan here, I do it on my blog if and when I need to or via calls when people come asking for it. I share a couple of generic pointers which i felt were necessary comments on the ongoing conversation
[29/09/18, 12:57:59 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Bhai Log, Shaanti 😊 It's just different perspectives.. A learned man can explain quantum physics to a kid in a very simplistic manner irrespective of him/her being a TG but provided he is given space/time rather than holding him by the collar 😀 Have a great Saturday!

[29/09/18, 7:14:06 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Dear all, I need to create my email signature which should ideally include graphics (my organization's logo), my designation and a simple design. Can you please recommend me the best way to create it without getting into much of the technicalities?

[29/09/18, 7:18:24 PM] Nitesh Manav (pushstart): Thanks for the tag Akant sir. 

Hi Raja, you can try using WiseStamp as suggested by many or NewOldStamp but both needs premium version for branding free signature.

Or you may try this wonderful email signature generator by Hubspot : https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator

If you need more option, elegancy and customisation, our team can design something for you.. ( but will take some time )

[03/10/18, 12:49:04 PM] Ridhima (ps): It won't be a full blown co-working space. But it would do good to lease it out to 2-3 young start-ups. A bunch of startups at the Nasscom campus in Noida keep looking to shift to their own place, so that can be a good starting place. Otherwise, you can make it a small co-working space for small teams/individuals of team size 2-3.

[03/10/18, 8:24:13 PM] ‪+91 94410 48409‬: I can totally relate to that. Most of the times the harassment also happens because such interviews are rigged at times.
[03/10/18, 8:43:44 PM] Nveen (ps): I wish it was rigged because of that they ask tough questions. I just feel there needs to be a better way of recruiting. I’m not even asking for myself. It’s for my wife that went to multiple interviews and the questions and how she was treated is between harassment to degrading a person just for pleasure
[03/10/18, 8:44:12 PM] Nveen (ps): I know this is not the platform. But I am asking because i feel there has to be a change.

[03/10/18, 9:55:10 PM] Nveen (ps): I am talking about the interview process with recruiters hiring on the behalf of other companies or companies themselves. The type of questions asked are sometimes beyond personal and labeled.
[03/10/18, 9:55:48 PM] Nveen (ps): sure sounds good
[03/10/18, 9:57:04 PM] Nveen (ps): Recruiters hiring on the behalf of other companies and companies as well
[04/10/18, 12:15:38 AM] Vanshi (ps): Literally; last salary SHOULD NOT be asked. That sets the ceiling and floor and is unfair to candidates. I felt so weird giving out my last salary. 
It’s such a personal question. It kind of felt against my right to answer.
[04/10/18, 12:23:45 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): that does suck ! clients do the same and i just qoute a per hour cost to them
[04/10/18, 12:23:52 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): you must try the same with jobs
[04/10/18, 12:30:33 AM] Garima Kholi (ps): I’ve experienced various such interviews where interview panel did not show up, I was rebuked on my handwriting in a recruitment form, asked questions about marital status, plans to get married, in one interview the panel tried to fit me in a basic admin role instead of position I applied for.

There are various reasons for this to happen.
I am sure many interviews are rigged.
Also, it’s a key learning to choosing a company that suits you than you suiting a company.
[04/10/18, 12:32:55 AM] Garima Kholi (ps): Also I’ve written to interviewers when such incidents happen to put it on record when someone representing a company tries to harass a potential applicant with hope to avoid other people actually getting harassed.
And they’ve all come back, responded to apologise.
[04/10/18, 12:40:35 AM] Nveen (ps): But it’s still happening. Maybe it’s an opportunity to be exploited and improve the process.
[04/10/18, 12:41:09 AM] Nveen (ps): I’d love to have ppl come in on the idea.
[04/10/18, 12:45:37 AM] Garima Kholi (ps): Even if you build applicant’s confidence, the one at the end of providing the job would be seen of higher value, at least in India.
[04/10/18, 12:46:09 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): the issue is the companies will reject it
[04/10/18, 12:53:17 AM] Nveen (ps): I am sure socially sound companies that understand the issue will back it.

At the end of the day, nothing gives anyone a right to abuse/misbehave with the other person no matter which side of the table you have been. Sometimes I wish they were just human at least.

Our past investments include Grey Orange Robotics, Eltropy, Gigstart, Intellivision, Tala, RevOS, HeyMojo, Quizziz (17 in all) over the last 7 years. 

Happy to answer any other questions around fund raising, pitching et al 

Good day

[08/10/18, 5:50:19 PM] Bits Spark: Since, this is asked in jest. Sure. 
You can also shut your company down. 

A co-founder leaving is a huge red flag for any investor. So you might be in a soup later :)
[08/10/18, 5:52:20 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Hahahaha well on a serious note, I have talked to a lot of bits pilani guys when I was building a team and also while hiring and I feel they have lost the will to do something different.

[08/10/18, 5:54:07 PM] Bits Spark: Damn, sorry to hear that. I would suggest that there might be sampling bias at play here. 

By objective metrics, we're alive and kicking ass :)
[08/10/18, 5:55:41 PM] Bits Spark: Dude, if anybody took your opinion seriously, I would be worried.

BTW, any luck finding an example of psycholinguistics in empathy building while applying HCD?

TiE is probably not going to help much in that. There are some chapters better than others - I think Pune guys r good, not sure about Delhi
[12/10/18, 5:50:32 PM] Nistha Tripathi (pushstart): Am happy to connect n share more pointers if u want.
[12/10/18, 5:52:56 PM] Mohit Walia (ps): Dude LinkedIn is your best friend
Connect and reach out to investors and mentors.
Send out a message, send them an invite 
Apart from that there are a lot of incubation programs in the city, google em

[16/10/18, 5:46:13 PM] Abhishek (tripvenza): Hi, do we have any directory to see the list of startups we have in push-start entire community
[16/10/18, 5:46:27 PM] Vanshi (ps): That would be amazing @918779219493
[16/10/18, 5:59:13 PM] ‪+91 79826 65583‬: Nice thought
[16/10/18, 6:00:03 PM] Neeraj Joshi: List of startups? Why?
[16/10/18, 6:04:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yo! Anyone have connects with comic con?
[16/10/18, 6:04:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Kindly dm
[16/10/18, 6:06:57 PM] Aditi Chada (ps): Thx
[16/10/18, 6:09:51 PM] Pulkit Bhatia (ps): Just another linked thought. A directory of pushstarters along with the services(free or paid) in their expertise they can offer. Can mention their available timeslots as well.
[16/10/18, 6:11:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: This will reduce the engagement here bro
[16/10/18, 6:11:13 PM] Neeraj Joshi: People will directly connect with each other
[16/10/18, 6:12:11 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): For trivial things we should give them that. This community could then be used for engagement in untapped regions maybe
[16/10/18, 6:12:41 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): nope it should not happen, i dont want people randomly pinging/spamming me all day
[16/10/18, 6:13:09 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes
[16/10/18, 6:13:43 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): identity is best kept to the mods, if you want a specific service, ping neeraj or someone
[16/10/18, 6:13:47 PM] Vanshi (ps): Just have email addresses
[16/10/18, 6:14:31 PM] Pulkit Bhatia (ps): Just a thought.it will be only when you ask them to in ur mentioned timeslots.ofcourse we can have more filters
[16/10/18, 6:15:06 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): All we should look at is improving the service towards the end goal. The end goal of this community
[16/10/18, 6:15:06 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): definitely no, i am already exhasted with facebook, google, linkedin, microsoft, CIA, RAW, ISIS stealing my email id, and consumption data, dont want to add pushstart to the list lol
[16/10/18, 6:15:13 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): *exhausted
[16/10/18, 6:15:39 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): but then thats just me
[16/10/18, 6:15:52 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): You can choose to give your email/contact details. Doesn't need to be mandated. As it is in every other social media you mentioned
[16/10/18, 6:15:54 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you want to connect with anyone very specific, as @919662915070 rightly said, you can get in touch with me
[16/10/18, 6:16:33 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Why would we as a community share data of our users with everyone?
[16/10/18, 6:16:35 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Lol
[16/10/18, 6:17:09 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): thats not the end goal of the community
[16/10/18, 6:17:21 PM] Pulkit Bhatia (ps): May be yes..but it will give them a platform n direct POC for offer they need..this group can be used for better fulfillment than reading groups messages which are irrelevant to them
[16/10/18, 6:17:38 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): I didn't even definite the end goal. What are you saying isn't the end goal? 😂
[16/10/18, 6:17:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: While joining the community, pushstarters give their info in the hope that we won’t share the Data with anyone and everyone. :)
[16/10/18, 6:18:07 PM] Neeraj Joshi: It will be kept safeguarded by us
[16/10/18, 6:18:08 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i am saying connecting people is not cos thats the context we are talking about !
[16/10/18, 6:18:20 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): please do that !
[16/10/18, 6:18:45 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): And that should definitely not be done. I'm just thinking of a repository which could maybe help the community
Just throwing ideas here
[16/10/18, 6:22:15 PM] ‪+91 79826 65583‬: Its a good idea..i'm looking for a service or provide a small service to fellow pushstarters.it will help
[16/10/18, 6:24:37 PM] ‪+91 78984 98881‬: +1
[16/10/18, 6:24:51 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): what service
[16/10/18, 6:27:08 PM] Pulkit Bhatia (ps): Not share all data but of only those who wish to help fellow pushstarters. also,pushstart can charge a small fee to make sure info. on this restricted weblink is not misused
[16/10/18, 6:27:44 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): but then you can just post on fb and get the results as well !

[16/10/18, 6:33:32 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The content that is created on pushstart community is read by 10k people who are part of the community and not only the one who is asking a question and the one who is answering it.
[16/10/18, 6:34:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We would want you all to use the platform to ask questions and seek connections
[16/10/18, 6:34:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So that the value gets created for you as well as the ones who are reading
[16/10/18, 6:34:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The content
[16/10/18, 6:36:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Sharing contact details, will Lead to offline connects directly.
[16/10/18, 6:37:13 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Why would anyone use pushstart platform if they can directly contact people they wish to connect with?
[16/10/18, 6:38:47 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): Exactly. This will help us find more reasons which Push-start could be used for. Venture into "new spaces"
[16/10/18, 6:42:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Ok. So what do you want us to do? What kind of data you want us to share? Do think over it and let me know
[16/10/18, 6:42:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Would love to have a conversation on it :)
[16/10/18, 6:42:58 PM] Neeraj Joshi: After all it’s our community ♥️
[16/10/18, 6:47:18 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): Exactly. I was just thinking out of the box. Sorry if I came on wrong 😅
[16/10/18, 6:47:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: No bro.
[16/10/18, 6:49:01 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): I'm not exactly sure right now. But maybe a list of go to person with an area of expertise. So if I'm looking to clear a doubt regarding Web Hosting, I can just ping an expert on it after looking at the repository.

The expert would have chosen to commit his/her time to this. Filled a form, about where he/she would prefer to be contacted, when to be contacted etc.

Push connect cannot work through the repository but certain doubts can
[16/10/18, 6:53:22 PM] Pulkit Bhatia (ps): Exactly.Moreover if we are worried about data, just the name, expertise & available timeslots. N for contact info., they may get in touch with admins
[16/10/18, 6:53:43 PM] Manas Bansal (hydps): We can together brainstorm on this more.
How the repository can be expanded, and _also_ the scope of this community
[16/10/18, 7:36:44 PM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): So this happened to me right now.. chrome forced logged me in while I was logging in on my gmail. And the moment I signed out of the browser, I got signed out of my gmail too, not to mention the bookmarks and passwords I lost because I didn't want google to keep me signed in.

Any one else facing this issue? It is a big threat to development community.. coz google now has access to every database/server you own. And I am surprised nobody is taking this privacy concern up.
[16/10/18, 7:50:43 PM] Prasad Shripati (pushstart): Exactly.... Moreover they didn't notify users when a)  updating chrome with these changes b)  specifically notifying me when logging into chrome. This is another series privacy invasion by them after the Google map, search slip ups. 
I have changed my default to Mozilla Firefox.
[16/10/18, 8:00:49 PM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): Yep, it has to be firefox now... "Built for people, not for profits"
[16/10/18, 8:10:22 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Yes
[16/10/18, 8:10:27 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Firefox for the win
[16/10/18, 8:10:32 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Faster better more secure
[16/10/18, 8:17:12 PM] Ashutosh Vyas (pushstart): Firefox was there even before chrome.
Why die it loose the shine and chrome took over?

Any insights ?
[16/10/18, 8:20:43 PM] Prasad Shripati (pushstart): I found its interface much better plus transferring bookmarks and password was easier

[26/10/18, 7:46:57 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): #pushreference
#pushconnect

Hi Delhi PushMembers,

I along with my Partner will be  visiting #Delhi post Diwali to meet our clients. 

I need help in following two ways from folks in Talent Acquisition/Talent Specialist/SaaS product domains to meet new prospects.

1.
I currently run a #TalentAcquisition firm based out of Ahmedabad/Bengaluru and wants to meet people who are from this domain.

I am looking forward to meet/chat with peeps who work as Talent Acquisition/Talent Specialist with any of the Startups/Investment Houses and others.

In span of few months we are already working with Edutech/Fintech (Series B-Series C), top AMCs and few MNCs from Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru.

Connects from #OYO #Paytm #PaytmMall #PolicyBazar #Zomato #Grofers #Droom #Rivigo and #Investmentangels would be highly preferred.
#techstartups 

2.
This is a interesting project as we are working onto it since last more than 1.5 years focused on #SaaS products and communities. Our aim is to help the early stage SaaS products into the market to get the next needed momentum by building a value and trust around their products. 

Anyone working on SaaS products based out of Delhi would like to catch up and understand as to how we can help you in your growth. 

We have already worked with some of the interesting SaaS products from across the globe. Now we will be coming out of our long Beta with a full launch.


Any help/reference/tags would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,
Gaurav

I'll be visiting Centre of Neuroscience to understand more about the WHY, HOW and Functioning of Brain.

My intent is to understand the link between brain,  sleep, synchronicity of senses and movement. Also, to explore the domains: colour psychology(impact of colours on brain), impact of calligraphy on brain,  retention, memory and processing of information on brain. Idea is to leverage the learnings from IISC in BRANDING, UI,  UX and Perception Building. 

I would like to take questions which you might have.

Shoot! 

Thanks,
Aditya Raja

[01/11/18, 2:59:44 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi Pushstarters, congratulations on building together a thriving startup community in India. I have been a part of Pushstart for quite some time now and have seen numerous launches of some great products and have scooped brains behind those products. 

I am a product marketing manager for a small but fast growing B2E business. We have a product that we have been using internally for sometime now to streamline the devops process within the organisation and it has been quite fruitful for us. We plan to launch it for other people in the community to get them started with devops quickly and intuitively. But for that I need some feedback from you guys.

Just some questions to understand your team’s pain points and overall outlook at the devops process within your organisation.

If you build, manage and deploy release pipelines within your organisation, or anything remotely associated with devops. I would love to hear you out and ask you a few questions.

Here’s the link to reach me out on Whatsapp: http://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=918527464661

[01/11/18, 4:44:21 PM] Akash (pushstart): To all wonderful PushFamily Members from Delhi and NCR. 

How many of you are able to relate your journey with any point below:
1) Many Startup Founders, especially who are core techie, have built amazing products but are not able to Sell it due to undefined Sales Process. 
2) Recruiting & Managing Sales Team is a big challange with most of the startups. 
3) Nearly 60% of sales leaders ranked sales conversations as the most important factor in creating competitive differentiation. (And you also believe the same)
4) Most of us wish to get rid of wasting time on prospects and face difficulty in finding qualified leads. 
5) Challenges faced while doing sales demotivate us and even sometimes make us doubt our products. 

We at Groomers are starting our Nano Degree Program on Sales Management with Year Long Assistance from Domain Relevant Industry Experts. This educational course is specifically designed keeping in mind the above points. 

We are organising our First FREE Demo Class in Creator's Gurukul, DLF Phase 2, Gurgaon on 18th November 2018.

[06/11/18, 11:57:56 AM] Uneza (pushstart): Welcome @919772229891  to Push-starter  :)
[06/11/18, 12:51:26 PM] Digendra Rathore (pushstart): Hi, pls advise what's a decent internship stipend amount that should be offered to someone who has to dedicate full time and can work from home.

It's a Swiss Army Knife type role. The candidate shall primarily work in doing primary and secondary research and make ppt, reports etc in varied unrelated sectors and do marketing on social media as well.
[06/11/18, 12:52:17 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Hi fellow PushStarters!

I am Shikhar. Currently, I am exploring Startup investments domain with a project called *Zero Capital Fund*.
Prior to this, I have worked with several startups, engineering their products and converting ideas to MVPs.
Looking forward to having fruitful discussions here.
[06/11/18, 12:53:35 PM] Neeraj Joshi: best way is to look for similar profiles on angel list and check their stipend out ;)
[06/11/18, 1:31:25 PM] Akash (pushstart): Any social media active page admin here? 
#pushconnection
[06/11/18, 1:32:42 PM] Akash (pushstart): I mean a page with 1L+ likes or an insta account with good number of followers.
[06/11/18, 1:40:43 PM] Nitika (pushstart): We have 10k followers on insta
[06/11/18, 1:49:58 PM] ‪+91 96324 44388‬: Intern may not be able to delivery the expected outcome in the area of research specifically. I think,  engaging the academician doing PhD in similar area might be the better choice to get research data outcomes and pocket friendly as well. Second option could be engaging  the research agency to get better value proposition. As the last option,  you might go with engaging the intern model.  Stipend ranges between 3k to 45k per month that is precisely based on the capabilities of candidate.
[06/11/18, 1:58:27 PM] Raghu Nadan (ps): Good to see you here Shikhar, is Blocksmiths is still on ?
[06/11/18, 2:02:56 PM] Raghu Nadan (ps): Anything which makes the other person, comfortable enough to work for you without any compromise for the sake of saving few thousand. 
Its not about how much you pay , its about how much he brings value on the table.  So better do an open table discussion how much you can afford and clearly ask whats the value or how much he is willing to contribute.
A full time person, might not be even working full time, at times even couple of hours is more effective compared to entire day.
[06/11/18, 2:04:23 PM] Shikhar (zerocapitalfund): Hey Raghu! Unfortunately, BlockSmiths shut down earlier this year.

wishing u and family a very prosperous, productive, passionate, peaceful and pollution-free year ahead.

Dear @918779219493

I wish and I'm sure, you'll take Pushstart to global level soon. Your passion shall multiply along with your energy to manage the growth, hassle and hussle.

You are doing a commendable job for the startups and founders. For some people, It may be just a small act of creating and managing a community of entrepreneurs, but belive me it takes a lot in terms of your time and energy and I know it's not easy.

But then, who said that creating a future of your choice is easy, it's tough and kudos to you for choosing to create one for yourself and not sneek into what the world gives you. 
 
Hapy Diwali to all 🙋🏼‍♂😁

[24/11/18, 7:20:40 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!

[24/11/18, 9:00:22 PM] PG: Where can I buy Gita in English? Need to send it to France.. 

Any suggestions??
[24/11/18, 9:21:02 PM] Garima Kholi (ps): Any bookstore will have it. 
You can buy the Iskon one from a bookstore or from thr temple. 
There are various editions also depending on the interpretations, so check that.
[24/11/18, 9:23:54 PM] PG: Haan but France nahi deliver kar pa raha
[24/11/18, 9:24:02 PM] PG: Trying
[24/11/18, 9:24:11 PM] PG: Gita press wala version bhejna chah rha hu
[24/11/18, 9:28:15 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): I think there would be very limited copies left.
[24/11/18, 9:28:47 PM] PG: hmm
[24/11/18, 9:39:30 PM] Akash (pushstart): Try Iskcon. They have it. And they are world wide available

[24/11/18, 9:52:15 PM] Garima Kholi (ps): Gita Press Shop is in Nai Sarak, Chandni chowk.
Directly go buy from there. Also help them survive in this amazon ka zamana.
[24/11/18, 9:54:12 PM] Prabhakar (ps): I shouldn't say this but iskon version of Geeta might be mis interpreted.
[24/11/18, 9:55:27 PM] Akash (pushstart): That can happen 😅 I don't know much about Iskon publishing.  Someone just gifted it to me two days back.
[24/11/18, 9:58:22 PM] Jeferson (ps): I have a friend in Germany. Who might purchase and courier it to the address in France for you. It would be cheaper for you that way to send across. 

Check if that works out for you. I can help connect.
[24/11/18, 9:59:41 PM] Jeferson (ps): Iskcon version of Srila Prabhupada 's interpretation.
[24/11/18, 10:01:20 PM] Garima Kholi (ps): To each his own. 
Gita as it is accepts anyone to accept or refute any interpretation with your own logic.
[24/11/18, 10:03:44 PM] Prabhakar (ps): Gitapress website has option to order online. Check out if you can send it to France from there.

[02/12/18, 1:45:24 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
As per our promise, Bringing the much-required change to our Community in Delhi NCR! 

We are *PREMIUMISING* this Whatsapp group!

*Why the CHANGE?* 
Our aim @ Pushstart is to build a collaborative ecosystem for YOU to grow YOUR Business by making relevant content and connections accessible to YOU at a lightning fast speed! 

We believe that *relevant CONTENT* should be accessible to everyone who wants to or is pursuing entrepreneurship and that’s why the *Pushstart FB Group*.  

But

*Relevant CONNECTIONS* should be only accessible to people who are pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME and here to GROW their Business: 

*And that's why the change!*
[02/12/18, 1:45:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *What is the Change?* 
To start with We are changing the Entry Criteria and Process to get into this Whatsapp Group as well as the kind of offline meetups that we will do in the future.
[02/12/18, 1:46:20 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *New Criteria:* 
From now on we will allow ONLY and ONLY serious Genuine Entrepreneurs who are looking to GROW their Business in this Whatsapp group.
[02/12/18, 1:47:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We have realized that this group won’t create ROI for the ones who are startup enthusiasts and not really pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME as of now. 

FB Group would be more relevant for them to learn, pursue entrepreneurship and then become eligible to join this group.
[02/12/18, 1:47:09 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Process:* 
As we want this to be a highly CURATED and CLOSED community, from now on it is COMPULSORY for everyone to fill this form before becoming part of the community: http://bit.ly/Pushstartform.
[02/12/18, 1:47:24 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *How are we implementing the Change?* 
It's a request from all of you to fill this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform if you want to become part of our New Premium Community of Delhi. 

The first deadline for form filling will be End of this Tuesday. Kindly fill this form latest by tomorrow. 

Me and @919819946239 will be spearheading the Change!
[02/12/18, 1:47:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: This is the first step towards evolving this Community as a Premium offering. 

Will be sharing the whole new version in the near future! 

Hope we make sense here.

Let me know if you have any queries :)

Cheers!
[02/12/18, 1:48:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Starting with the first Step of *CURATION* as of now ❤

[03/12/18, 1:53:29 AM] Uneza (pushstart): Broaden your thinking, founders. Of oyo, ola or uber will not automate everything , how will you define you process, will you ask the product manager or developer to build  the  process, who will understand the griveance,
[03/12/18, 1:53:40 AM] PG: sir ji haath jod ke.... maine sirf itna kaha, agar full-time ki zarurat hai toh bilkul rakhiye not because it is fashion or so called that company must have a HR (as observed in many cases). Agar freelance se kaam chalta hai toh option hai, nahi toh full time rakhiye. I am not aginst hiring full time HR. Read again that I only say uske liye 40 hours/week ka kaam hona chahiye employer ke paas. That is it. :)
[03/12/18, 1:55:28 AM] PG: Sir, no personal comments plz. Not about how broad or narrow is my thinking. If putting my point across makes you judgemental about me, then think otherwise please :)

#Urgent
[06/12/18, 12:17:29 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): Seek previous available backup from GoDaddy, they may initially refuse saying you don't have backup service subscription, however keep firm and ask them you will pay for it. Generally they do give. Call up on their Indian customer care number
[06/12/18, 1:20:23 PM] Aayush (Pushstart): College fest
[06/12/18, 1:26:48 PM] PG: I did, they agreed but then they checked and there was no backup
[06/12/18, 1:33:01 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): Keep pushing, keep talking to different support executives, that's normal of them to say initially they don't have, keep on offering that you will pay, raise it to next level of support. I did go through this sometime back and got the backup finally.
[06/12/18, 1:34:10 PM] Arjun Singh Kalra (delhips): It is a norm to have a backup for every host provider. What will happen if their servers crash and it's not your mistake, they do bring back all your data, no matter whatever hosting plan you are on.

[07/12/18, 8:15:43 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Engineering learning aid is no longer a good product in India

[07/12/18, 8:23:25 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Something very similar
[07/12/18, 8:24:22 PM] Akash (pushstart): They do.
[07/12/18, 8:25:14 PM] Sayan Ganguly: So basically if governments start doing their business, they are dead in the water. So they are trying to emerge as strongest players in the market so that B2G becomes a cakewalk for them
[07/12/18, 8:25:29 PM] Sayan Ganguly: That's pressurizing their employees
[07/12/18, 8:26:04 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Who end up giving bad reviews
[07/12/18, 8:27:29 PM] Sayan Ganguly: So. This is what I suggest. If you see any offer, evaluate based on employee reviews and what their business is and what could be the threats to that and how are they trying to avoid that.
[07/12/18, 8:28:04 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Merely employee reviews do not form a complete evaluation
[07/12/18, 9:02:06 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): I have to save my friend I guess after reading all the comments 😀
[07/12/18, 9:02:47 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Maybe you should

[07/12/18, 9:04:32 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): Aisa to kya hain??
[07/12/18, 9:04:33 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Which also gives salaries at par with Heavily funded startups?
[07/12/18, 9:04:44 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): Which one ??

[13/12/18, 11:43:20 AM] Ashutosh Kumar (pushstart): Based on my interaction with thousands of Startup founders and wannapreneurs, I recommend these goal setting and visioning questions that will help you re­imagine success however you define it.

Q1: Describe what you want the business to be like one year from now. How much time will you spend working? How much money will you make? Which tasks will you delegate, and which will you do yourself? What kind of projects will you work on? Paint a clear picture with the most accurate description you can.

Q2: What were your biggest challenges last year and how did you address them? What systems, procedures or practices can you put into place so that these challenges don't recur in the coming year?

Q3: Which people or organizations have the tools, expertise or resources that will be beneficial to your work? How can you form a relationship with these people or organizations?

Q4: What are your biggest business strengths, and how did you develop them over the past year? How can you continue to leverage and develop them over the coming year?

Q5: What is a large goal that you have that scares you, but you know the potential rewards are great? What can you do this year to work towards that goal and overcome your fear or hesitation?

Q6: What are the low value tasks that take an inordinate amount of your time? Can these be outsourced or delegated?

Q7: And lastly, what one goal would you pursue this year if you know you could not fail?

Not everyone has the time or the opportunity to be a good mentor, and convincing someone to put their time and energy into being yours takes more than just a quick email. Landing a great mentor means you have to choose the person you ask carefully, ask them the right way, and then know when to follow up (and when not to follow up, for that matter.)

Choosing the right person as a mentor is probably the biggest factor to whether they'll accept your request. Most people want mentors who exemplify their vision of success—business leaders, entrepreneurs, recognizable names—it's easy to want to have a famous businessperson, developer, or activist as your personal mentor. Odds are though, those people are already busy or unavailable, and while it never hurts to ask, the odds are heavily against you. Remember, your mentor doesn't have to be a household name to be a good one—anyone whose experience and wisdom you can learn from would make a great mentor.

Their outreach people themseleves research for people and their stories then feature them based on that. Plus they sometimes also ask for recommendations from existing speakers as well.

[16/12/18, 8:39:46 AM] PG: I'm curious too..
[16/12/18, 8:42:07 AM] Deepka Dubey (ps): Probably those are the silent/inactive ones.
[16/12/18, 8:43:57 AM] PG: Oh, I remember. I guess it's connected to that form... That NJ shared...
[16/12/18, 9:11:14 AM] Gopi Krishan Bali : 😊
[16/12/18, 9:42:12 AM] Mayank Jain (delhips): Hey Guys,how can we generate a pdf having images in it on server side using django,it should be generated on server side or frontend?
[16/12/18, 9:45:57 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): You guys shouldn’t remove people just because a form wasn’t killed and also you can never have 100% active users on any group.
So there will be bound to be people that aren’t active or don’t respond, and I feel it’s not right to simply remove them.
One needs more brand promoters/ambassadors not the opposite! 
Just a thought, I’m sure you’ll have a reasonable answer.
[16/12/18, 10:34:35 AM] Astitva: I agree. I'm in a couple of more long running entrepreneurship community groups and they curate them by selective admissions. Once in, it isn't a positive impact to kick someone out.

I know you've been intimating people about the "form" since a long time but then it isn't in the best interest to make bitter relationships with members by kicking them out.

Just my thoughts.
[16/12/18, 10:35:25 AM] Neeraj Joshi: So what’s the solution? Keep random folks in the group?
[16/12/18, 10:36:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: We didn’t curate the group to the start. The group link was public and many random people joined in. 

Also we haven’t kicked people out without a reason. 

We have personally messaged each and every one of them and asked them to share their details.
[16/12/18, 10:37:23 AM] Neeraj Joshi: If they don’t really care to fill a single google form after multiple requests, we can’t help it
[16/12/18, 10:37:47 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): There has to be better ways to incentivise these people too you know
For more active participation 
In order to improve relevancy can think of ways/filters on on boarding
[16/12/18, 10:37:48 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *at
[16/12/18, 10:38:21 AM] Neeraj Joshi: People weren’t removed based on activity bro. Most of the folks who got removed didn’t fill the form
[16/12/18, 10:38:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Few of the ones were removed because they weren’t found relevant
[16/12/18, 10:40:21 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Activity wasn’t take into consideration while removing anyone :)
[16/12/18, 10:40:37 AM] Unnati Bagga (pushstart): You guys are doing right. There are so many deals that are run inside the group. With data, there is surety of who is who. No frauds.
[16/12/18, 10:41:19 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Finally someone got it right. 🙏🙏
[16/12/18, 10:43:23 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Also we didn’t force the form filling into anyone. It was there choice. We have enough time for the same.
[16/12/18, 10:43:37 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Unmm I haven’t seen one person even care about thinking who they’re putting up the information about
While posting on the group
If data is an issue heck the person shouldn’t even post anything on a group of 100+ people
[16/12/18, 10:44:01 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Bro trust me time is subjective 
If someone is busy with work and had been procrastinating it for the weekend 
Well then too bad for him:her?
[16/12/18, 10:44:20 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Anyway just my thoughts 
You guys are better judge of this!
✌🏼🙏🏼
[16/12/18, 10:44:58 AM] Neeraj Joshi: They still have the link with them. 
We have personally messaged them the form link. 
They can anytime fill the form and join again ☺️☺️
[16/12/18, 10:46:03 AM] Mohit Walia (ps): Now we talking 👍🏼
[16/12/18, 10:46:17 AM] PG: Hey push family
