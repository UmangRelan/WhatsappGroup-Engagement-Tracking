[02/05/18, 2:00:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Updated the group DP with the new set of rules
We will call this group as a PushRequirement group
[02/05/18, 2:00:35 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Where you can Push your requirements and Seek:
1. Connections
2. Recommendations
3. Opportunities
4. Cofounders
5. Help
[02/05/18, 2:00:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Discussions regarding Meetups are always encouraged
Apart from this nothing else is allowed
[02/05/18, 2:01:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Thanks
[02/05/18, 2:01:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Any feedback on the rules is welcomed
[02/05/18, 2:01:21 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Pm me
[02/05/18, 2:49:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: @919819946239 will be moderating the discussions
[02/05/18, 2:49:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 😋😋
[02/05/18, 11:22:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So I have been asked and told multiple times to allow discussions on the WhatsApp group and I don’t really encourage that. 

The reason is: 

I want maximum pushstaters to become part of the discussion and get benefitted:  
 
3 type of people become part of the discussion: 
1. The one who starts it: 1%  
2. The one who contributes: 4% 
3. The one who reads and learn: 95% 

If things are discussed on WhatsApp group: 
Total strength: 250 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 250 

On FB group: 
Strength: 8k 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 8k 

See the difference? 

The information shared in the discussion is priceless and a larger impact will be created if we can funnel all of it to the FB group. 

That's why: 
1. Share Idea
2. Launch Startup 
3. Ask Questions 
4. Share Content 

ON FB GROUP 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/Pushstarter

So let's impact the lives of thousands of entrepreneurs by doing all the discussions on the FB group. 

Thanks

[03/05/18, 2:21:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Lets pushstarter-source the list of most active pre-seed/seed investors from India?

[08/05/18, 10:45:13 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I am ok with it
[08/05/18, 10:45:20 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Adoption is very less

[08/05/18, 10:45:48 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I don’t have a problem if everyone wants to shift to telegram
[08/05/18, 10:46:04 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Also our daily activity would decrease

[08/05/18, 10:48:25 AM] Ashima (pushstart): keeping both will even make it more detrimental. My suggestion would be to keep one preferable whatsapp till we exceed the limits here. People need to see the value of the group before they download another app

[08/05/18, 10:51:29 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Ok. First lets build the community in Pune

This is the first rap produced by Wicked Broz in collaboration with Freestrings films. Just some fun with Dharavi based Mc Altaf, New York based Jay Kila and Bollywoods star boy Ranveer Singh.

We are looking for some sponsorship to make it reach its potential and be showcased to the people across India.

See if there is any way in which you can help out with a brand ready to invest in such an opportunity.

[18/06/18, 8:12:22 PM] Archana Kedia (Daftar): How is it a spam though??? It isnt a joke/lie/meme/etc.
[18/06/18, 8:12:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: No issues :)
[18/06/18, 8:12:57 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): No worries. I thought it was spam because it was put two times.

1. We want all Pushstarters here to be very sane and mean everything that they out and type here. 

2. That is why we have banned forwards. 

If you want people to come to your event, start of by building a conversation. Introduce yourself to people and tell a breif info about the event. Then, ask who is interested..then drop.
[18/06/18, 8:13:47 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): This leads not only to more conversions of your leads but will also prove the genuinity of the event.
[18/06/18, 8:21:00 PM] Archana Kedia (Daftar): I guess u guys should conduct an orientation/induction program for people whom yu add to the group. We all here r working professionals/startup entrepreneurs. Even we dont like to be a part of groups that would lead to spamming n all. And i am assuming we wont have another group just for uploading events. 
This did not really look like spamming per se. Or a forward.
[18/06/18, 8:21:31 PM] Archana Kedia (Daftar): @918779219493 please share the dos n donts of th group again over here. It will give us all a clarity

[21/06/18, 6:53:05 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): This is the 8th year of the Anjani Mashelkar Inclusive Innovation Award
that had been set up in the memory of R A Mashelkar's late mother, who always persuaded him to use science and technology for the benefit of the needy- especially the poor. They have had great winners in the previous years, more information is available at- https://lnkd.in/fcSDvDi

This award presents an opportunity to spur and fuel innovation for the benefit of the most disadvantaged sections of society in order to ‘include’ them into the mainstream. It also has another equally important aim: to sensitize innovators about the problems faced by such sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.

The awardees will preferably be those who believe in not just ‘best practices’, but ‘next practices’. Most importantly, it will value solutions that represent ‘affordable excellence’, breaking the myth that ‘affordability’ and ‘excellence’ cannot go together.
As the award grows in stature and gains national recognition, it will endeavour to leverage support for the innovator from various other private and public sector organizations.

Criteria-
Only Indian organizations or persons of Indian origin are eligible to apply.
Innovators of all ages may apply.
The nominations should be for prototypes or proof of concepts which have the potential to be successful innovations. Raw ideas will not be considered.
The prototypes, products, services or business models should be original and novel.
They should provide highest quality affordable products and experiences to the resource poor people.
The innovations should substantially and positively affect the quality of life of the disadvantaged sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.
All applications should clearly explain the innovation, the originality of the idea, its benefit, and impact.

Well, Who doesn't like to be healthy and fit?💪 But it comes with the price and hard work.
We observed few problems like,
1. Overpriced personal trainers 💰
2. Underqualified gym trainer along with lack of attention 😞
3. The science behind a personalized meal or workout plan is not possible by an individual to knowledge and time constraints 🤯
4. Overwhelmed and confused with too many online videos/trainers/blogs etc 🤔
We would like to address this problem with help of the personal virtual assistant which is best at its job, cheaper and always with you to understand your needs 🤖

We would like you to spare few minutes to fill out the survey to understand your problems and adoption of virtual assistance for an ultimate long-term solution 😎

Thanks in advance. Your honest feedback is valuable to us.

Kindly spend 2 minutes of your valuable time and fill out the feedback.

[22/06/18, 5:23:17 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Hello guys Harshal Shroff here, After running and exiting my operations of 18 outlets and retaining the brand of This Corn,I visited my home town(Chinchani in Palaghar district) after 8yrs of living in Mumbai, I see that not much has changed here apart from the fact that people consume more data(Due to JIO and the current data based marketing) on their phone and are slowly getting aware about "The power of internet and connected lives" it's more like electricity, which still has power cuts in many rural areas. It's been a overwhelming experience of starting up once and humbling to exit and start once again.

However, Schools and bussiness dont see the value of data connections, and even if they do.. complete connectivity becomes an issue due to unstable Network performance.

In the comming one month i am LOOKING to connect and speak with people interested to build multilingual and affordable ways to bring 4G/5G broadband and connect applications to Rural India with "wireless street level WIFI connectivity, based on renewable POWER solutions to effective ways to deliver digital access to people with incomes less than 10k/month

If you are interested or are connected to people/startups who focus on this area do help me connect, we are also looking to connect with affordable Telecom equipment manufacturers and Network infrastructure creators.

Ideally ex-employees of companies like Telenor india, Storeking,Airjaldi,Aervoyce, Wifi Dababa, Digital empowerment foundation or people in the government helping digital india movement in the RURAL areas

Currently we are preparing to build an application for applying for a CLASS A or a Unified, Virtual Network Operator (VNO) licence.

Our Aim is to build
-Robust cheap wireless street level connectivity infrastructure
-Delivering NEW experiences and products to Rural India in affordable ways
- Delivering sachet(Under 50INR) size data,learning,insurance and investment solutions.

If your a passionate problem solver and internet enthusiast and would like to contribute to the iniative, in your free time which may lead to a full blown position..feel free to join the group. Here -- https://chat.whatsapp.com/CXRDhMeMy2i2HSSzh1reUd

If anyone had complaints with LinkedIn App or Desktop version and had not got them resolved.

I guess this can be an opportunity for you to bring those issues or errors.

[25/06/18, 1:57:05 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I did a simple thing. 
When I update my profile or when and old anniversary comes.

People start sending me many texts for congratulations.

What  I did- 
Prepared a set or two replies purely customized for two set of people. Those who are very high value and very close 

Those who are recent or general.

But gave the message a look that it never sounded to them that it is a template kind of message.

And never replied instantly. Took an hr or so or even a day to reply. 

Thus it got me 95+ % of replies and conversion.
[25/06/18, 1:58:08 AM] Chahat (pushstart): Pro tip👌🏻

[30/06/18, 9:51:53 AM] Neeraj Joshi: [Long Read] - Invite for Social Samosa's LIVE Conference

The team at Social Samosa is excited to pay a tribute to the medium which is a driving factor for the evolution, existence and sustenance of quite a lot of Brands, Agencies, Publishers, Platforms, and Creators!

When we set out to recreate the #SMLive Magic this year, I was told 8 Million People and 2 Lac+ Video Views were possible in 2017 and it's a tough nut to crack considering the friendly NewsFeed algorithm.

As ambitious as it may sound, riding high in the faith and power of our community of Marketers, Agency Professionals, Creators, and Practitioner we are all set to take the challenge and breach the circles of virality with #SMLive2018

We plan to kick-start the day with a Keynote Address from one of the pioneers in Indian Advertising and Marketing Industry - Mr. Ashish Bhasin

Taking the baton from him C-Suite Advisor and Power Influencer - Tanvi Gautam will take us through the essentials of Building an Authentic Personal Brand on Social Media

Anoushka Adya, Rashi Ray and Mounica Tata DoodleODrama will discuss on how Social Media has emerged as a great tool to enable Women Empowerment

This is just the beginning; next up we have Kainaz Karmakar  and Harshad Rajadhyaksha from the team which managed to win Ogilvy India's first CANNES Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness this year with Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks. They will speak about the LITTLE they know about Great Advertising!

A lot has been spoken about the various applications of Data across, Ashish Tiwari will share a different perspective on Data-Driven Storytelling to craft the right message

Chandramohan Mehra from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will bring in the flavor of Hyper Current and Topical Content with anecdotes from their collaboration with Dabbu The Dancer aka The Dancing Uncle

Threading thoughts from being responsive and customer-centric at all points in time, Vineet Singh will share Quick Social CRM Hacks to win over audiences

Mr. Bean from the Indian Digital Industry, Nitin Bhatia will enunciate the importance and relevance of Data in the value chain

Shifting Gear towards some Creator Tales, Ranveer Allahbadia - The Beer Biceps will share his story on carving a niche amongst the content clutter

The Master Storyteller behind some of the most engaging original content from Kingfisher, Sandeep Balan will draw parallels between Branded Content and Original Content

Over the past few years, Wittyfeed has become one of the largest Viral Content Companies and Parveen Singhal will share Growth Hacking Lessons in the process of building this new age company

Nidhi Bisht and Sarjita Jain from India's Leading Women Content Channel will sum up the #SMLive2018 show with a talk on Creating Entertainment for Women with Brands

That's the amazing lineup we have been talking about ever since we launched the initiative this year; as we strive to raise the bar and make this BIGGER & BETTER we are counting on your support to make this happen!

Come and join us to Celebrate #WorldSocialMedia Day

- Show Interest/Attendance to the event here bit.ly/SMLive2018

[30/06/18, 5:55:50 PM] Prathmesh (pushstart): Interesting. How does this compare to Fitternity ?
[30/06/18, 5:56:59 PM] Pooja (ps): Fitternity gives you access to one gym and we give you access to more than 300 gyms and studios all across Pune through one membership
[30/06/18, 5:59:42 PM] Pooja (ps): We also have interesting fitness groups we create and connect people who have same outlook and can workout together
[30/06/18, 6:00:07 PM] Pooja (ps): There are weekend activities like trekking and neon football matches we arrange
[30/06/18, 6:01:08 PM] Nikunj verma (pushstart): Curious about  how many ppl actually want to "swing" between multiple gyms. It work since food where people crave variety but for gyms i thought ppl choose the most convenient one and build a habit around it. 

Just an innocent  and genuineon. Good to hear about fitato again after a long time!
[30/06/18, 6:07:39 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Share the same on the fb group5
[30/06/18, 6:16:38 PM] Pooja (ps): Hey Nikunj, 

Fair point. But quick question how many of us have actually made it a habit? When you played cricket as kid, did you enjoy it or did you measure the inches around your waist? When you watched Fight Club, did you feel the urge to try MMA? 

Fitato is exactly trying that of how to enable you that an hour a day which you thoroughly enjoy and connect with yourself , not only a six pack ab but a better physical, mental and social self. Frankly, I want you to explore the limitless possibilities both life and fitness has to throw for you and truly experience the rush when you try something new, and that little smile that appears on our faces. 

For most of us who spend 10 hours a day behind a laptop having that dream body in 3 months is a little tough but having a hour when you have a little fun and a more fulfilled day. Maybe :)
[30/06/18, 6:16:45 PM] ‪+91 83779 10491‬: More than swinging between gyms, it's about mixing up your workouts. You could alternate between gymming, yoga, martial arts, go swim one day, do MMA.
[30/06/18, 6:19:02 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Hi @919112176848

Anyone who can help me build a simple app which uses Google sheets as a database? Its *not* for launching it on google play-store. It is going to be a simple app restricted to few devices. UI is not as important as the functionality of the app.

Can anyone tell me how can I find out the revenue made by service for any phone company? By service I mean the revenue made through repairs at their service centers.

I am guessing the companies might share some report for their annual share holder meeting or disclose it for attracting investment or anything.

[15/07/18, 12:34:23 AM] Aman (pushstart): Well WhatsApp has its Api and you can also run it in loop to send bulk SMS but that might not be a good strategy. 
If users are in your contact then that's fine else they would mark msg as spam.
[15/07/18, 12:34:51 AM] Aman (pushstart): *bulk msg
[15/07/18, 12:35:15 AM] Aman (pushstart): Lemme know in pm if you wanna know more about its Api.

[16/07/18, 5:03:10 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Harsh is busy AF. Already did with Pradeep once
[16/07/18, 5:04:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What about fundraising through crowd funding?
[16/07/18, 5:04:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: this sounds good?
[16/07/18, 5:04:53 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Yup
[16/07/18, 5:04:59 PM] Aman (pushstart): 👌🏻 ek no.

[16/07/18, 5:05:57 PM] Arbab (pushstart): We need to have better topic not evwryone goes for crowdfunding, so it will be very niche based thing for example I will not come
[16/07/18, 5:06:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Had done it long time back
[16/07/18, 5:06:27 PM] Arbab (pushstart): Thats my personal opinion about niche based stuff
[16/07/18, 5:06:41 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Flat hierarchy Vs pyramid ?

[16/07/18, 5:07:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes, you are right @Arbab (pushstart). But these days entrepreneurs are looking at alternative options to raise funds. 3 startups recently shared their Crowdfunding campaigns on PS.
[16/07/18, 5:08:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: It can be helpful to you as well. Won't you be interested if you can raise funds for Upskill throught Crowd funding?
[16/07/18, 5:08:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *through

[16/07/18, 5:11:20 PM] Mohit Nagaria (pushstart): I think it would be interesting to explore new opportunities to raise funds. 
Fundraising is a hard and tricky affair.

Another suggestion is on Design Thinking for product design.
[16/07/18, 5:11:48 PM] Arbab (pushstart): You asked for opinion I gave one, I feel like more important topic like " team building", prototyping of a product, sale are more important as of now, we have open topics too, from the point of view of audiance niche based will have low audiance and from last 4-5 AMA we are having less engagement. So I am just putting my point, rest is upto you

[17/07/18, 11:43:37 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I think @919674089398 @918867532421 @919769711030 @919833737374 @919604208747 can share their experience of previous PushMeetup that we had around a month back
[17/07/18, 11:43:55 AM] Atijya (Pushstart): Here?
[17/07/18, 11:44:02 AM] Atijya (Pushstart): Or on the group?
[17/07/18, 11:44:16 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes bro. PushMeetups are a regular thingy now. We will have atleast once every month in Pune
[17/07/18, 11:44:20 AM] Neeraj Joshi: here bro :)
[17/07/18, 11:44:30 AM] Atijya (Pushstart): Oh awesome. 👍👍🏿
[17/07/18, 11:45:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: you can become part of the meetup by filling this form: http://bit.ly/PushMeetupform
[17/07/18, 11:51:06 AM] Atijya (Pushstart): I went to my 2nd Pushmeetup, the official one -- about two-three months ago. 

I was grateful to be surrounded by people who knew what they were talking about, to help identify exactly what ailed my venture -- something the world in a law school can't seem to be able to afford me. 

After we were done, I had a clear vision of where I should head, with a few chinks in my plan to move forward -- identified, and dissected.

It was intense, and believe it or not, after the meet I went home, drew out a clear laid out plan, and followed it. Not everything that was shared, but some of it.

Believe me that's just what I needed. In the months that followed, I doubled down on Quora to grow from 500 followers to be at 2.7K right now. 

I then leveraged this new found influence to build a team of listeners (people who listen to you without any judgment or inhibition) around me -- a team of 20 right now -- with 20-30 mails dropping in from people eager to join in, every single day. 

The site was relaunched, the process of listening was automated (not kidding), and we've handled around 100 chats in just 3 weeks. 

Neeraj is the man, and this Pushmeetup is just what I needed. A beer would've been nice though. 😇🤭

[19/07/18, 2:39:34 PM] Prathmesh (pushstart): Well since you're looking for "world class" talent, it might be a good idea to pitch
why a "world class" content writer would want to work with your company when they may be presumably having
several other options ? That might help perhaps.

[20/07/18, 12:02:13 AM] Prathmesh (pushstart): Check the course and book Mining massive datasets by Jeff Ullman and co.
[20/07/18, 12:03:11 AM] Prathmesh (pushstart): It assumes some familiarity with databases and stats. A gentler start is Intro to data systems specialization on coursera.
[20/07/18, 12:04:16 AM] Rinkesh (pushstart): Okay thanks 😃
[20/07/18, 12:22:18 AM] Prathmesh (pushstart): Also if you are interested in engineering aspects of deep learning, I would recommend checking out  this course:
http://dlsys.cs.washington.edu
It gives a nice overview of how deep learning libraries like tensorflow work under the hood. The course I think is built on nnvm/TVM stack.
[20/07/18, 6:50:05 AM] Jayesh (axonator): Yes upload is slower and download becomes faster, thanks to rains. Data coming down comes faster due to same direction of water drops and data! And the data being uploaded has to fight an uphill battle slowing it down.

We are developing a Pill Dispenser which will be useful for assisting care-takers to make sure that the patients and people under medication are taking their pills/tablets regularly according to their prescription.

This unique pill dispenser can dispense the right quantity of pills/tablets of each specific type (Maximum of six different types of pills), at the desired time with an alarm. It also comes with an app, which the care-taker can use to control and check the pill dispensing completely making it safe from over-dosage or forgetfulness of taking the pill.

Please fill this form if you would be interested in the product.

Note: The following details collected are for research purposes and the developing team may/may not communicate related to the product alone.

[26/07/18, 4:17:18 PM] Neeraj Joshi: A Brief about Shabia:
[26/07/18, 4:17:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Wild Earth' was born out of Shabia's fears of what she put on her baby's body after she became a mother. The labels scared her and the fact that she did not understand what went into the products made her uncomfortable. Being the solution driven person she is, Shabia started making soaps and lotions in her own kitchen. Soon word spread and mothers were demanding her to make the full range. Her experiments proved to be a huge hit with everyone and soon she was forced to move from her kitchen to a proper office and workshop. Today Shabia is proud to have created a brand that provides natural quality products which young, old and babies can use without any fear of side effects of harsh chemicals.

'Wild Earth' today sells online, thru retail stores, is a huge gifting opting for corporates and is exported to quite a few foreign countries, purely on the basis of its quality and the pure intention behind the brand, an intention that was born from a mothers heart and not in a business school.

Not satisfied by her own achievements, Shabia also wanted to share her share of blessings with those who are not so blessed or loved. And again with this intention of giving back, 'The Bluebells Community' was formed.

When Shabia is not rustling up stories or spreading smiles with her social initiative 'The Bluebells Community', she loves to whip up a storm in the kitchen cooking or design new products for 'Wild Earth'. Shabia lives in Mumbai with her cinematographer husband Ravi, 8 year old daughter Sia and dreams of her daughter growing up in a world with no boundaries or borders.

Shabia is also the winner of the 'Rex Karmveer Chakra Award' (2015-16, 2016-17) Women of excellence Award 2016' 'Top 50 Rising Stars Award 2016', & 'Digital Women Achievers Award 2017', 'ICICI Advantage Woman Award' & the 'Women of Influence Award' by I Inspire 2018 for her exceptional work in her profession and the field of social work.

[31/07/18, 9:41:44 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Any ideas on what it can be?
[31/07/18, 9:41:54 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Both Online/offline works

[31/07/18, 9:46:35 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Everyone can share a piece of article summarised, that they read, that they think is worthy of sharing.

This way we get access to good information in a day.
[31/07/18, 9:47:35 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Secondly we can keep pune centric.

Lets say every week one day we identify problem in Pune amd them see if any startup is solving or it can be solved by govt or something new?

All can put in their comments.
[31/07/18, 9:48:07 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The motivation to be in this group is to seek connections. I don’t want to build a new motivation
[31/07/18, 9:48:24 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Okay.
[31/07/18, 9:48:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I am looking for something which motivates pushstarters to seek connections and network here :)
[31/07/18, 9:48:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: For ideas/knowledge sharing
[31/07/18, 9:49:07 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We have the fb group

[31/07/18, 10:11:56 PM] Mayur (ps): When I know something about a person, I tend to trust them more
Met Satyam, Rinkesh and company last small meetup and obviously it helps to build a bond

How can we get to know each other better is the direction to go maybe.
[31/07/18, 10:12:24 PM] Neeraj Joshi: yes you picked the right spot bro. Respect. keep going
[31/07/18, 10:15:55 PM] Mayur (ps): AMA sessions are impressive
They are for info
Maybe mutate AMAs for info not about domains but people here and their products/services/teams/companies/journey

Say on a fixed date, x number of random people are chosen for AMA and get that rolling. X>1, because 1 might not have enough content to share.
[31/07/18, 10:21:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Oh yes. This is amazing. Can actually implement this. @918210579249 what do u think?
[31/07/18, 10:22:41 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Pick up the ones who contribute the most and an AMA session with them 😜
[31/07/18, 10:23:17 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Facebook AMAs have issues. Like I face issues while playing videos and stuff. There is friction many a times. 

But I really appreciate the information. 

Can we not use a different platform to facilitate the AMAs?
[31/07/18, 10:28:22 PM] Mayur (ps): Facebook has proven to be a boon for social communities like ours when they startup but very problematic when they scale.
Those who follow legendary Pune Eats Out group might have come across a scandal there recently which was simply caused by facebook not having sufficient structure for different types of communities (a rating and reviews system for each member would have avoided it for those who don't know).
So yes, need to branch out eventually and keep fb only for social, not core.
[31/07/18, 10:37:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes that’s what we are planning to do. Branching out of fb soon :)

Hi, my team have been working on a social networking site for a client and we are struggling with an issue in its design. 

When we reduce the screen size, the design gets distorted; earlier we were thinking the issue is with design but now I guess the problem is with sessions. 

Would be grateful if you or anybody could help us figure out what exactly the problem is.
Please Pm. 
TIA

AMA: All of us have constant questions about the deep (dark?) world of VC funding or investments in general across different levels (Seed to Growth). 

Today, as discussed with Neeraj Joshi, I am doing an AMA to answer any of your queries in and around this topic. 

About me: I have been a global investor and a serial entrepreneur, with multiple successful exits and investments across countries, using my roles as founder of a VC firm while being Advisor to a number of others. 

I take pride in building multi-million dollar companies, Great Manager Institute being the recent one. I run quite a few companies in different geographies. 

I am NOT an expert. I am just a learner and a perennial student.

[10/08/18, 4:04:16 PM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): hey guys, we are thinking of opening our TAX calculation API to public. However, before we do that I am studying its feasibility. Basically we already have a tech that helps to calculate various taxes based on location, product type etc. Have you used anything similar for your SaaS product before? if not, do you think this will be helpful for your invoice/tax calculations? Plus, if there is anything else that I should consider. You can PM me.

[15/08/18, 6:55:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi All! Posting on behalf of The Goa Project (TGP).

The Goa Project is an annual “unconference” that brings together a diverse set of people from various fields – to converse, collaborate and co-create. The entire agenda is crowdsourced, leading to two exciting days of talks, workshops, presentations, pitches and interventions. Run completely by volunteers who are passionate about cross-sector learning, collaboration and ideas.

The sixth edition of TGP will happen on the 26-27th of Oct at a secret location that's NOT Goa! Yes you heard that right. We're also launching a week long (19-25th Oct, 2018) fully-funded TGP Residency where business owners, makers, thinkers, do-ers will be matched with inter-disciplinary collaborators bringing in an opportunity for both venture owners & collaborators to work on innovative solutions! 

This is where you come in! TGP is looking to reach out to exceptional venture-owners who will bring interesting flavors to the residency (they're also looking to find equally interesting collaborators, but more on that on a later date) and for this, included below are the application and more information links. We urge you to apply right away (deadline is 18th Aug), if you know someone who could benefit from this too, do spread the word to them as well!

Application link:  https://goo.gl/forms/ebqciZ1NTJf3oasZ2
More details on the residency: http://www.thegoaproject.com/eligibility-criteria/ 
FAQs: http://www.thegoaproject.com/faqs/ 

If you think you'd make an awesome volunteer instead, apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/ZpBmUvsQYv4IGQ8F2 

Appreciate the help!
Thanks!

[16/08/18, 7:57:45 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): Its good that he is looking for a girl. Also even in my team i prefer girls for sales and marketing. Been in this field for 13 years, personally i have noticed that i would handle clients in a better manner then most of my male counterparts.

[16/08/18, 8:15:29 AM] Nagraj (ps): That's the good part dear. The sad part is you experienced men cannot do this job better.
[16/08/18, 8:17:04 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): Did i say that, i said i could do better than most of them.., they did their part
[16/08/18, 8:30:53 AM] Nagraj (ps): Your right. 👍🏻
[16/08/18, 8:33:10 AM] ‪+91 90110 91941‬: My whole reason of asking was that, I dont think and strongly feel that roles are not gender bias. So if a prospective employer has specifically asked for he/she for a role, I want to understand the logic .

[16/08/18, 9:00:46 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): @918779219493 , can I share the article I was talking about?
[16/08/18, 9:01:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: sure
[16/08/18, 9:01:25 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): Anyone who is into client acquisition, would agree that it really is a tough nut to crack. Most of us don't even like pitching because it is so unpredictable while being one of the most vital aspects of any business.

What if I tell you that most of the people do suck at pitching because of one, very simple evolutionary phenomenon?

What if I tell you that there is still a way in which you can overcome this. Well, it's all in the MIND!🧠🧠🧠

You will be fascinated by unraveling how different things are  from what we ASSUME.

Read on to dive deeper into understanding how the evolution has made pitching so complex and how we do have a way to use Psychology for turning the tables into our favour.

Hi friends,

I have so far conducted more than 40 interviews with women from 20 or so countries for my book on women's global empowerment.

For my next set of interviews, I would like to talk with women who have experiences (good or bad) of women helping women, in the form of, for example, sponsorships, mentorships, networking, job referrals, survivor support groups, entrepreneurship training programs, and financial self-help groups. For the sake of diversity, I am particularly interested in interviewing women who are not from the United States.

If you have any suggestions, send me a message here on Facebook or email me at simon.hedlin@post.harvard.edu

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aERYDzrXEwTHleJ6PpuG-5_HOrEenKXwVsUdbvMu9Rc/edit?usp=sharing

I’ve recently initiated a new venture and call the company Food Master Inc. If you see food on Television, YouTube, Facebook or anywhere else and long for it; you should be able to enjoy the exact same thing at a restaurant near you. Ideally while it is being aired live; but you will be able to request from previously showcased food as well. Any show, any media, any food, all at a restaurant near you. This is where and why I may need help of the Pushstarter family. 

A pilot run for FoodMaster will go live in Pune on September 10, 2018. Please do visit our website *_www.FoodMaster.co*_ for more information.

[22/08/18, 10:28:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Why not take fresh graduates from colleges in Pune? There are tons of colleges in Pune if I am not wrong :)
[22/08/18, 10:36:48 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Freshers for BD is not a great idea
[22/08/18, 10:37:56 AM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): I agree to this. Aggressive BD needs someone who has got his hands dirty in the market. Btw, even amlooking for one BD in Pune for a digital agency
[22/08/18, 10:38:27 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): They lose hope super fast
[22/08/18, 10:39:17 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): ....:). More than getting his/her hands dirty, they should know the market, domain, company they are approaching, hierarchy, decision makers, interest levels, Pitch and what not
[22/08/18, 10:41:32 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What about freelancer bds? What are ur comments on them?
[22/08/18, 10:41:50 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): They are not freshers
[22/08/18, 10:42:13 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Plus, having a BD guy in the team is much better than freelancing
[22/08/18, 10:42:19 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Especially for a startup
[22/08/18, 10:42:54 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): They are the ones who hunt, grow and cater to your clients. 
Agencies or freelancers do their hunting job and shy away
[22/08/18, 10:43:44 AM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): True, can’t agree more

My name is Shashank Gupta and I have recently shifted to Pune from Mumbai. (*Last week itself 😬

Have lived in Mumbai for almost 3 years. 
Started with Reliance as a process engineer and moved on to join a startup named Blinge In 2015 as BD guy in very early stage. 

After Blinge, worked with Shop101 almost for 2 years as BD and then PM. 
(*Worked as BD intially, set up the whole operations and set up the Digital Marketing activities and then moved on to do PM for one year)
 
Had quit Shop101 in April'18 and started working on my own idea. 😇😇

Currently, we are working towards change in the Use&Throw behavior of humans by substituting single use plastics by superior alternative such as edible straws, cups and ice cream sticks. 
We are in R&D phase and now working to make the commercial fit product.

PS - Already a part of Mumbai Pushstarters

[23/08/18, 1:32:31 PM] Mayur (ps): Very confusing
As a user I absolutely hate ads and block suggested content in an instance. As a marketer, I can see the appeal though. Depends on fine desyils I guess. What are the charges, model, promise etc
[23/08/18, 1:35:46 PM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): Actually it is not going to straightforward like SMS. There are lot checks and balances added by FB. So no spamming can be done.

[25/08/18, 2:02:01 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Life is at an halt in the state of Kerala, due to heavy rainfall and opening of almost 35 dams. According to the Government records, 324 deaths and 223139 people have gone homeless and admitted in 1500+ relief camps. Sources say that Kerala is facing its worst floods in 100 years. 

Where will these people go? 

The students of Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth, have come up with an initiative in order to provide them with the basic means to live including food, clothing, shelter and rehabilitation.
The major goal of this initiative is to support those people who are affected by the floods, in whatever way possible. As we are in the affected areas (Ernakulam, Kerala) , we are able to feel the necessity for a plan of action or an initiative to help and serve our people. 
We have started an online campaign in order to raise fund --

https://www.bitgiving.com/savekeralasavepeople

And, we have raised almost 8.2 Lakh in 4 days. Almost, 132 families were provided with basic requirements for their meal and stay. Groceries, utensils, medicines, toiletries and 2 sets of dress including undergarments, Sanitary Napkins. 
Recently, when we visited the relief camps, we found the scale of huge destruction: houses have turned into piled bricks, roads are broken, mud is there everywhere. It has been noticed that there has been a stark increase in the number of air and vector-borne diseases. 
For instance, in a camp in Arakkunam, there were 16 pregnant ladies who were stranded without proper food, care and nursing. After three days, they got the doctor after a series of rejection by multiple doctors.
This made us ask the question: What can we do to help the homeless pregnant ladies and Keralites at large? Is 8 lakh enough to serve the people around us? 

The blunt answer is NO. 

It isn't enough. It Isn't enough to even help one family cover their rehabilitation.
Hence, we are asking for more funds. To make the process transparent, we will have a sheet where we calculate each and every expense we incur. 

Service before self is our motto. Humanity our religion.
Please support Kerala. Rebuild Kerala.

Feel free to suggest me the names of companies who did that. Would be very helpful. 

Also, can anyone help me put in touch with Mr. Mustafa(I.D fresh food founder) and Mr. Jaydeep Barman(Faasos founder)
[28/08/18, 12:39:35 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: Cool. Is there an example you can share?

[28/08/18, 12:49:51 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: I presume you were trying to sell Affiliate Marketing product. So how did you reach your target audience? Ads? Forums? Social Media?
[28/08/18, 12:55:16 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): Yes, I was trying to understand the market before planning a workshop in Vietnam as the investment was huge. I used social media ads for the same

[28/08/18, 1:53:01 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: Apparently, I was reading your post on yesterday! I was having difficulties proceeding. 
May be you can help me with it, if you can spare some thoughts..

My idea is an online film making school.
According to your list, the first step is to 'Identify who is the "right customer" for your idea'
In my case, that will point to "people who are interested in film making and willing to pay for it to do it online"
[28/08/18, 1:55:22 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: From facebook, I got some numbers like 700000 (from the ad manager interface). Now the challenge is to identify whether they will like to pay for an online course.
[28/08/18, 1:55:56 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Can we check for a metric like people who bought the last week?
[28/08/18, 1:56:29 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Many dropshippers target such customers. 
Maybe.
[28/08/18, 1:58:44 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: Any suggestion for source of such data?
[28/08/18, 1:59:50 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Trying to find an article on the same.
[28/08/18, 2:00:30 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: thanks
[28/08/18, 2:57:05 PM] ‪+91 90086 44448‬: Your target customer is going to film makers (already doing it.. help them to learn advanced aspects , students who want to venture in film making (to help them learn this easily) . )
[28/08/18, 2:58:58 PM] ‪+91 90086 44448‬: The digital campaign has to be targeting these people ( find people studying film making, film making institute students, professionals in film making, ). Also you can expand to people who like some specific aspects of film making but may not do the film themselves.
[28/08/18, 3:02:49 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: I too thought so. But I was thinking they may not be the right audience. My rationale being, they are ready to join an offline one, they may not be interested in an online one. But then I realized that it is just my hypothesis..
So I'm considering interviewing them..
[28/08/18, 3:13:28 PM] ‪+91 90086 44448‬: Learning is moving to digital if they see value in it
You need to understand how offline training works and the challenges in it that you address as selling points 

Also check the Masterclass campaigns 

You can also do a blended course in partnership with someone already conducting it offline. That might be easier acquisition means and building the offline to online
[28/08/18, 3:14:57 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: Noted. Some are already considered.  Very helpful insights.
[28/08/18, 3:56:07 PM] Abhishek Gond (91 Navi Mumbai): Hey Pushstarters!!

We have been given a task to identify a problem with any product, develop (max 3) solutions for the same and prioritize them according to your research. I have found out that their is no customer support for the new buyer or for the existing buyer who has a query regarding a certain product if you have not yet purchased it. To validate this problem statement I have created this survey with some creative solutions that may increase and facilitate customer support. For the research part, I need some data of  various age group customers and their opinion regarding the problem statement and the solution.

Time to complete the survey: 30 seconds

[14/09/18, 10:11:45 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Pmd
[14/09/18, 10:12:05 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): 1. Set out the values on which your company is based on, ones which run into the culture and blood of the organisation.
2. See if the current logo is trying to signify/convey the same to your target customers.
3. If not then go for a change, else stick to it.

Avoid hiring designers for 99designs and Fiverr. Here is an awesome reference.

[14/09/18, 10:43:44 PM] Nikunj verma (pushstart): I am not sure if a logo is supposed to reflect your organization culture. Isnt it more about reflecting your product or service attributes?
[14/09/18, 10:46:14 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Totally depends on you :)
[14/09/18, 10:48:18 PM] Nikunj verma (pushstart): Thanks. 👍
[14/09/18, 10:48:48 PM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): You're welcome :)
[14/09/18, 10:48:51 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Your products and services keeps changing, but the underlying principals remain the same, they are the foundation on which you build your products/services.

Check out YouTube videos by Paul Rand the one who designed the most legendary logos and signage of the century.

1. The IBM logo has black and white strips which denote the digital nature of the company and they always have been in that field.

2. FedEx has an arrow hidden in between as a whitespace. An arrow moving forward, as a company they believe in pushing your products further to their intended destination.

And there are many more inspiring stories around logos.
[14/09/18, 10:50:16 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): I don't mean the culture, I mean the values which make your culture, what do you all stand for, the common bond. Only they your target audience will be able to relate to you.

People don't buy what you sell, they buy because there is a common belief, a common value which is established through your branding. :)
[14/09/18, 10:51:04 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Please take it to the personal chat
[14/09/18, 10:51:15 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): A brilliant video to give you more information on this.

https://youtu.be/u4ZoJKF_VuA
[14/09/18, 10:51:19 PM] Nikunj verma (pushstart): Agreed. I thought you meant org culture. Values and vision definitely are drivers.
[14/09/18, 10:51:35 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Oops, sorry. Will take care next time.
[14/09/18, 10:52:26 PM] Nikunj verma (pushstart): Have watched many of his videos and like his way of thinking

It is great connecting with you all!
[Too Long but Do Read]

I am looking for people who are interested in building their personal brand for a huge, untapped audience in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

In terms of numbers, urban India with an estimated population of 455 million already has 295 million using the internet. While, Rural India, i.e., Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and villages, with an estimated population of 918 million, has only 186 million internet users. Thus, there are 732 potential million users still in rural India. 

These numbers seem mindboggling right?

Also, here's the catch: The internet is built for a native English speaking audience. If this is not enough, there is a huge content gap for the rural audiences as well.

And for Content Creators, the bigger problem is of competition on already famous platforms like Youtube.

Hence, I am here asking for as many connects as possible.

Of whom, you may ask? 

I am looking for New and Upcoming 
Experts
LinkedIN Influencers
Bloggers
Instagrammers
Youtubers
Facebookers 
who want to come on board and create content, build their brands, be the first movers, and become famous amongst the untapped 900 million Indians out there.

What is a First Mover Advantage?

Superwoman Lilly Singh- joined Youtube in 2010 and has 14 million+ subscribers today. Youtube was only taking off in 2009 in the USA.

When Youtube came to India with full force in 2014, Bhuvan Bam started his channel in 2015 and now has over 10 million subscribers!

But both of them joined Youtube when it had just started gaining traction in their respective countries. That's your First Mover Advantage. As the years went by, the numbers only compounded.

If you can see the potential in this vision, please fill out the form below. You can also forward this to people who you know are working towards building their personal brand and want to reach a massive audience!

https://goo.gl/forms/hIkSl2bC4aYgUpIx2

My team will get in touch with you as soon as possible. Cheers to all of you hardworking content creators!

And Thank you so much for your time!

From politics to blood mafia everyone is making it a commercial activity and innocent lives are damaged in this blood lust.. 

A few years ago, a few friends and myself worked on something to solve this problem and were faced with similar threats. Thanks to pushstart, ive met alot of people who have tried to do something similar and are still doing things in their personal capacity to solve this problem. 

I am seeking to connect to all such people who have tried solving this problems, through technology, NGOs or any other means!

Planning to unite them all and do something to have a huge impact. Pls DM me if you have the zeal, the passion and have tried solving this problem or tag someone you know who might be willing to collaborate and make this big!

Pushstart can do this!

What the name does not say, is that ISFiT is also the world’s largest international student festival. ISFiT is a non-profit organization and is brought to life with the efforts of more than 400 student volunteers. The vision of ISFiT is to create a better future for young people in the world.

ISFiT is arranged every other year, and each festival has a theme related to social and political topics with international relevance. This year’s theme is Migration. The festival is held in the city of Trondheim, Norway. Here, over 450 students from all over the world (that’s you!) gather to attend 19 different workshops and take part in the cultural program of the festival.

2 Questions :-

1) Any body has lost their money in banks by making a fixed deposit ? For example the banks closed due to fraud ?

2) If yes or even no, any possibilities to get that money back ? Any lawyer or expert in our group who can take this as challenge and opportunity to solve the matter. 

Suggestions and guidance are welcome

Thanks.

Let's PM
[11/10/18, 7:20:38 AM] Tanay (pushstart): Hi,

If the bank is taken over or merged your money is safe but if the bank closes you just get 1 lakh rs of insurance money and nothing else.

P.S these kind of scenarios are very rare but if u are caught up in a situation like this you cant do anything else.
[11/10/18, 7:26:48 AM] Nagraj (ps): Dear Tanay,

The insurance is for only nationalised banks. For example SBI,Bank of Maharashtra etc.

Its BHR cooperative society or so called banks which is not nationalised.

The bank and it's owners are from Jalgaon

BHR is a big scam which is started from Pune itself. The owners are already behind the bars since 3 yrs +
[11/10/18, 7:27:26 AM] Nagraj (ps): And you are actually right. I am unable to do anything 😢
[11/10/18, 7:30:57 AM] Tanay (pushstart): No sir its rbi guidelines to give 1 lakh rs of insurance to everyone holding a bank account it is in private banks and nationalised banks but i m not sure for cooperative banks but what i remember was any bank who gets registered has to give this amount of compensation i dont know this case exactly let me have a look in it and then we can see what we can do atleast you can get a lakh rs thats what i know
[11/10/18, 7:31:44 AM] Nagraj (ps): You knowledge is good. But it's not for cooperative banks and societies
[11/10/18, 7:31:48 AM] Nagraj (ps): Ur
[11/10/18, 7:32:45 AM] Tanay (pushstart): Commercial Banks: All commercial banks including branches of foreign banks functioning in India, local area banks and regional rural banks are insured by the DICGC.

Cooperative Banks: All State, Central and Primary cooperative banks, also called urban cooperative banks, functioning in States / Union Territories which have amended the local Cooperative Societies Act empowering the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to order the Registrar of Cooperative Societies of the State / Union Territory to wind up a cooperative bank or to supersede its committee of management and requiring the Registrar not to take any action regarding winding up, amalgamation or reconstruction of a co-operative bank without prior sanction in writing from the Reserve Bank are covered under the Deposit Insurance System. At present all co-operative banks other than those from the States of Meghalaya, and the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Lakshadweep and Dadra and Nagar Haveli are covered under the deposit insurance system of DICGC.
[11/10/18, 7:32:50 AM] Tanay (pushstart): I got it sir
[11/10/18, 7:33:02 AM] Tanay (pushstart): Even cooperative banks are covered
[11/10/18, 7:34:26 AM] Nagraj (ps): In that case can you confirm if we can get the money back.

If yes then whats and how is the process.

Currently am in Europe.

Kindly PM.

[21/10/18, 11:03:58 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
As per our promise, Bringing the much-required change to our Community in Pune! 

We are PREMIUMISING this Whatsapp group!
[21/10/18, 11:04:15 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Why the CHANGE? 
Our aim @ Pushstart is to build a collaborative ecosystem for YOU to grow YOUR Business by making relevant content and connections accessible to YOU at lightning fast speed! 

We believe that relevant CONTENT should be accessible to everyone who wants to or is pursuing entrepreneurship and that’s why the Pushstart FB Group.  

But

Relevant CONNECTIONS should be only accessible to people who are pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME and here to GROW their Business: And that's why the change!
[21/10/18, 11:05:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What is the Change? 
We are changing the Entry Criteria and Process to get into this Whatsapp Group as well as the kind of offline meetups that we will do in the future.
[21/10/18, 11:05:28 PM] Neeraj Joshi: New Criteria: 
From now on we will allow ONLY and ONLY serious Genuine Entrepreneurs who are looking to GROW their Business in this Whatsapp group. 

We have realised that this group won’t create ROI for the ones who are startup enthusiasts and not really pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME as of now: FB Group would be more relevant for them to learn, pursue entrepreneurship and then become eligible to join this group.
[21/10/18, 11:06:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Process: 
As we want this to be a highly CURATED and CLOSED community, from now on it is COMPULSORY for everyone to fill this form before becoming part of the community: http://bit.ly/Pushstartform.
[21/10/18, 11:07:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: How are we implementing the Change? 
It's a request from all of you to fill this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform if you want to become part of our New Premium Community of Pune. 

The first deadline for form filling will be End of this Tuesday. Kindly fill this form latest by tomorrow. 

Me and @919819946239 will be spearheading the Change! 

Cheers!
[21/10/18, 11:08:35 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I will be sharing further features of the New Premium Community Everyday from now on :)
[21/10/18, 11:09:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hope we make sense here.
[21/10/18, 11:09:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Let me know if you have any queries :)
[21/10/18, 11:09:51 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Cheers!
[21/10/18, 11:10:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Fill this form latest by Tuesday. It will help us better curate the new community ❤ ❤
[21/10/18, 11:12:03 PM] Neeraj Joshi: And for your kind information: The New Community will also be FREEEEEE. We won't be charging anything but it will be a more curated community with much more SERIOUS ENTREPRENEURS who wants to GROW THEIR BUSINESS :)

[21/10/18, 11:31:06 PM] Shashank Gupta (ps): Honestly, on an average a person has 9-10 WhatsApp group in his/her account.
While the relatives and family groups are most annoying one, there are some valuable group like Push start as well. 
I think it's the right move to curate and make it  more serious and genuine group. 
Too much noise would make this group redundant. 
Better to have 1 group with crazy 255 entrepreneurs than 3 with  mixed. 
How do you plan to do it? 
Little more clarity on criteria for the WhatsApp group please?

[21/10/18, 11:34:10 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes! Rightly said. We also want our Whatsapp communities to be SMALL, DEDICATED, CLOSED and HIGHLY curated with Members meeting at least once every month :)

It will lead to more Collaborations, Partnerships, and Conversions for pushstarters!

[09/11/18, 1:28:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Would you guys want him for an AMA?
[09/11/18, 1:30:59 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Dont you think we had enough of digital marketing guys for AMAs?
[09/11/18, 1:31:05 PM] Neeraj Joshi: haha
[09/11/18, 1:31:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: thats why asked here
[09/11/18, 1:31:28 PM] Neeraj Joshi: DM overload ho gaya hai na?
[09/11/18, 1:31:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: :P
[09/11/18, 1:32:03 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Haan kafi
[09/11/18, 1:32:12 PM] Jeet (pushstart): I would suggest we can focus more on two things
[09/11/18, 1:32:14 PM] Jeet (pushstart): One is
[09/11/18, 1:32:36 PM] Jeet (pushstart): 1) Operations in startups
Bring out leaders who can operationally solved some challenges.
[09/11/18, 1:33:00 PM] Jeet (pushstart): 2) Which is kind of most interesting is cost cutting, how to avoid cost overrun.
[09/11/18, 1:33:14 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Otherwise branding, DM, marketing is overdose.
[09/11/18, 1:33:28 PM] Jeet (pushstart): My views. 🙂🙂
[09/11/18, 1:33:28 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The problem is jeet, initiatives are driven by the interest of pushstarters
[09/11/18, 1:33:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We have done sessions on ops
[09/11/18, 1:33:48 PM] Neeraj Joshi: and financial management
[09/11/18, 1:33:54 PM] Neeraj Joshi: but they didn't get traction
[09/11/18, 1:34:07 PM] Vikash Ranjan Gupta (pushstart): Can we consider choosing a niche specific from DM?Like a blogging  expert,a FB ads expert, LinkedIn expert etc.There be more value eventually.
[09/11/18, 1:34:31 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Ohh okay. That means most of our target audience needs DM, then @918779219493 dont you think pushstart will become a dm community soon?
[09/11/18, 1:35:12 PM] Neeraj Joshi: yes this guy is a more of a blogging expert
[09/11/18, 1:35:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: nope this is the case with every entrepreneur community
[09/11/18, 1:35:44 PM] Neeraj Joshi: everyone wants to know how to get customers
[09/11/18, 1:35:55 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Problem is DM people are highly active on our group and other such groups.

Now i feel its time to conc on customer satisfaction, operational excellence, and other parametres. 

We can discuss more around legal aspect of the same.
[09/11/18, 1:36:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: people don't give priority to legal
[09/11/18, 1:36:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: aspects
[09/11/18, 1:36:30 PM] Vikash Ranjan Gupta (pushstart): Yeah...and let the questions revolve around blogging.
[09/11/18, 1:37:04 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Legal as in how to do founders agreement, what to take care while raising funds,  how to get trademark done, why IP, how to vest the equity among shareholders, how to form core team
[09/11/18, 1:37:39 PM] Neeraj Joshi: yes we will plan an QnA soon on this
[09/11/18, 1:38:06 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So see most of the QnAs and AMAs are open to any kind of questions
[09/11/18, 1:38:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 90% of questions revolve around marketing/branding/sales
[09/11/18, 1:38:50 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Totally agree with jeet
[09/11/18, 1:39:01 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): I'm a DM trainer n iv seen enough of DM related AMAs
[09/11/18, 1:39:06 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Pushstarters need to wake up to life outside of it
[09/11/18, 1:39:18 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Neeraj
[09/11/18, 1:39:24 PM] Vikash Ranjan Gupta (pushstart): Conversions, customer satisfaction,How to save taxes, building personal portfolios, retirement corpus,goal based investing...etc. etc etc.
[09/11/18, 1:39:46 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Not everything you run as AMA or any other initiative should be driven by the traction it receives
[09/11/18, 1:40:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: got it
[09/11/18, 1:40:35 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Exactly
[09/11/18, 1:40:48 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Bring out some really nice topics.
[09/11/18, 1:41:15 PM] Neeraj Joshi: can you guys help me with the topics?
[09/11/18, 1:41:30 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Yes yes i would really like to help you.
[09/11/18, 1:41:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: let me create a group
[09/11/18, 1:41:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: discuss it there
[09/11/18, 1:41:57 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): I think we should invite people from our community to conduct AMA on agri startups, public policy startups
[09/11/18, 1:41:58 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Sure.🙂🙂
[09/11/18, 1:42:04 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): I'm sure there are plenty of these unique conversation starters among us
[09/11/18, 1:42:40 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Just because majority of people believe in something doesn't mean it has to be true and correct..
[09/11/18, 1:42:52 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Exactly.
[09/11/18, 1:43:06 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I have created a group. If anyone wants to join and recommend topics
[09/11/18, 1:43:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: let me know
[09/11/18, 1:43:09 PM] Neeraj Joshi: will add
[09/11/18, 1:43:44 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): 👍👍
[09/11/18, 1:44:27 PM] ‪+91 90382 82186‬: Can you please add topics like trading, data science related , for carrier in risk analysis
[09/11/18, 1:45:10 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): That's the last thing any entrepreneur must do. If there isn't a legality then its not a startup but a family based business. 

Have been through both the phases and can so rightly state this..
[09/11/18, 1:47:13 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Neeraj, this time when we meet on my visit to mumbai can we also have jeet in the briefing ?
[09/11/18, 1:47:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes sure
[09/11/18, 1:48:11 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Jeet, please let me know If you are available for a quick 20-25 minutes chat. Thanks ! 

Thanks,
Giri.

[11/11/18, 7:30:05 AM] Rishi Kapal (EDUGUILD): Lot of people use numerology for a lot of things. Do you think startups use numerology to name their ventures? Or vastu to furnish their offices? If no then why not ? I had written a post on LinkedIn some time back about this. What are your views ? Do startups also use numerology and vastu? Should they?

[12/11/18, 4:09:42 PM] ‪+91 80074 56920‬: Namaste!

Hope you are in the best of the health and have had a wonderful Diwali!

I am writing this note to inform you about a significant change in my career & to invite you for a Seminar.

I have decided to move out of my corporate job after spending 13 years in the IT industry and working for top Banking institutes in the world for Compliance and Financial Crime domains. Now, I will focus on my passion for Technology & Law, by way of expanding our family law office into “Nyaya Niti – A strategic legal consultancy firm”. The firm will provide corporate & professional legal solutions across the domains, jurisdictions and forums. The firm will be driven by the core ethical values & will be operated using cutting-edge technologies and cross-domain expertise. The firm has an excellent mix of the wealth of wisdom & experience of the seniors with a plethora of freshness & technology expertise from youngsters.   

In the last few years, I participated in the *World Bank’s “Land and Poverty Conference” in Washington DC* and presented papers the topics of issues & possible solutions for *Land Acquisition and Investment Landscape in India* during March 2017 and 2018 respectively. Later, I presented the subject of *Vedic Jurisprudence* and its contemporary application during World Hindu Congress, at Chicago. I was also invited to speak on the role of ADR, *Arbitration & Mediation in resolving Technology Disputes* at National Law School India University, Bangalore.  I gave a presentation on the *Legal aspects of Blockchain in Financial Industry* at an industry conference organized by Thoughtworks.

We, at Nyaya Niti, also realized that as a society there is a need for inter-disciplinary legal research and policy organization. Therefore, we had several consultations with seniors and colleagues from various domains such as Medicine, Finance, Engineering, Technology, Sciences, Media and Law. We have decided to incorporate “Nyaya Niti Foundation”, which will be dedicated to the quality legal aid, policy research on the current legal challenges, and will also conduct a study of Vedic / Indic Jurisprudence.  

Coming Sunday, November 18, 2018, we are organizing an interdisciplinary seminar on “Legal & Ethical Dimensions of Emerging Technologies” at Pimple Saudagar, Pune. I have attached the invitation card and a concept note for the event with this message.

I, therefore, request your esteemed presence and participation in this event.

Regards, 
*Ashish Vilas Sonawane*                                                                                                                                                        (B.E., LL.B., LL.M. (p1), DCL,NCFM,CIBN)

[14/11/18, 3:21:35 PM] Krishnaa Kantthawala- Smart Foods: Hi, I am Ms. Krishnaa Kantthawala, founder @Smart Foods, a company that envisions providing health foods to promote nutritional and responsible eating. I was last working as a Global Brand Manager for a luxury tech company in Singapore. I moved back to India and have recently launched my RTC millet-based food brand – My Smart Millets.
Millets are foreseen as the next big thing in the $350 billion global health food market. The Government of India has declared 2018 as ‘The National year of Millets’ and the United Nation’s FAO has declared 2023 as ‘The International year of Millets’ to promote its goodness to the world. I wish to capitalize on it and establish Smart Foods as a leading global Millet brand.
I am looking for mentors who can guide me to transform my vision into a step-by-step plan to achieve my goal. 
Look forward to connecting and contributing.

[15/11/18, 2:22:48 PM] ‪+91 83088 25625‬: Hello Everyone,
I am Ashish Sonawane, a Techie, Banker and Lawyer. Below is my brief bio and also a note on invite for a seminar on coming Sunday. 

After spending a considerable amount of time in the corporate world, I decided to move out of my job. I worked for more than 13 years in the IT industry primarily for top Banking institutes in the world for Compliance and Financial Crime domains. Now, I am focusing on my passion for Technology & Law, by way of expanding our family law office into “Nyaya Niti – A strategic legal consultancy firm”. The firm will provide corporate & professional legal solutions across the domains, jurisdictions and forums. The firm will be driven by the core ethical values & will be operated using cutting-edge technologies and cross-domain expertise. The firm has an excellent mix of the wealth of wisdom & experience of the seniors with a plethora of freshness & technology expertise from youngsters.   

In the last few years, I participated in the *World Bank’s “Land and Poverty Conference” in Washington DC* and presented papers the topics of issues & possible solutions for *Land Acquisition and Investment Landscape in India* during March 2017 and 2018 respectively. Later, I presented the subject of *Vedic Jurisprudence* and its contemporary application during World Hindu Congress, at Chicago. I was also invited to speak on the role of ADR, *Arbitration & Mediation in resolving Technology Disputes* at National Law School India University, Bangalore.  I gave a presentation on the *Legal aspects of Blockchain in Financial Industry* at an industry conference organized by Thoughtworks.

We, at Nyaya Niti, also realized that as a society there is a need for inter-disciplinary legal research and policy organization. Therefore, we had several consultations with seniors and colleagues from various domains such as Medicine, Finance, Engineering, Technology, Sciences, Media and Law. We have decided to incorporate “Nyaya Niti Foundation”, which will be dedicated to the quality legal aid, policy research on the current legal challenges, and will also conduct a study of Vedic / Indic Jurisprudence.  

*Coming Sunday, November 18, 2018, we are organizing an interdisciplinary seminar on “Legal & Ethical Dimensions of Emerging Technologies”* at Pimple Saudagar, Pune. I have attached the invitation card and a concept note for the event with this message.

I, therefore, request your esteemed presence and participation in this event.

Regards, 
*Ashish Vilas Sonawane*                                                                                                                                                        (B.E., LL.B., LL.M. (p1), DCL,NCFM,CIBN)

[15/11/18, 2:29:08 PM] ‪+91 98902 67892‬: We help people narrate powerful stories whether during Sales, or giving a presentation,training,meetings, one on one conversations or public speech or sales pitch.  A sales person can connect better if they narrate a short story because facts or features don't stay too long with the customers however relevant and compelling stories stay for a longer duration and has a recall value. All the great brands have told their stories well e.g Steve jobs was a great storyteller and all the apple product launches had a story behind it.. Even in training , a good trainer uses story to make a point clear or a good facilitator talks about a concept with a story then it creates an impact.. We all love watching movies because at the end of the day we all are hardwired for stories :)

[16/11/18, 5:46:15 AM] Kedar Gadgil: What do you mean by "looking for a co-founder"? Is it like a job or a contract or how does that work?
[16/11/18, 6:41:55 AM] Dimple (ps): It's like a job and permanent.  Not contractual. .inviting applications for this as it would have a fixed salary plus equity.
[16/11/18, 7:20:21 AM] Dimple (ps): Co-founders and directors can also be hired.  So yes like a job. Full-time and permanent job.
[16/11/18, 8:11:11 AM] Kedar Gadgil: Thank you
[16/11/18, 9:34:25 AM] Amit Rawat: The lone Founder always looks for another person who is inclined with his vision and thought process. Also have same commitment & willing to share the load. I as a Startup mentor have connected many such people together
[16/11/18, 9:35:07 AM] Nisarg (pushstart): 👍
[16/11/18, 9:48:42 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): When I began my journey in the scene, I specifically chose partners who would be the exact opposite of me.. I wanted constructive criticism all along the way (which I got, a lot) and I also had to work hard to impress them with my ideas.. It was tough working with such people initially but finally I realized I made less mistakes and people who weren't really inclined to my vision were the ones who saw clearly at times when I couldn't.. Maybe my process is more difficult but trust me, I saw both sides of the coin at every step since such disagreeable people were around... The advice is to not be afraid of those who don't agree with you.. They are the most important asset for your company..
[16/11/18, 9:50:43 AM] Kedar Gadgil: I am curious. Can partners and co-founders be hired this way? Can they be headhunted? Are there any success stories of co-founders who were hired in this manner? Are these stories free of other forces besides finding co-founders post ipso facto?
[16/11/18, 9:52:22 AM] Amit Rawat: It's not exactly head hunting but sourcing/scouting for sure. Many of my mentee startups successfully did find people with skills & interest this way
[16/11/18, 9:56:07 AM] Pavan Chaudhary (pushstart): Pretty much - In one of the sessions arranged through Pushstarters, that of Sahil Vaidya i guess, he mentions of getting the co-founder via Behance - First working on a collab basis and then taking it forward as a cofounder
[16/11/18, 9:57:14 AM] Pavan Chaudhary (pushstart): 👍
[16/11/18, 9:58:50 AM] Kedar Gadgil: Any success stories? Like, say Infosys or Apple or Tesla or Nirma or AAP or any other startup?
[16/11/18, 10:00:50 AM] Amit Rawat: Apple, Tesla or most of these well know startups had the founding team knowing each other personally or similar domain/institution
[16/11/18, 10:01:31 AM] Kedar Gadgil: I know. That's why I am asking if there are any success stories of adding co-founders post ipso facto
[16/11/18, 10:05:41 AM] Amit Rawat: Usually co-founding positions aren't 'hired' u scout them out.
[16/11/18, 10:07:26 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): You can get to know people who are interesting if you look specifically for them.. I have done that on LinkedIn, but finally it's all about going with the person your gut tells you to go with..
[16/11/18, 10:08:34 AM] Nisarg (pushstart): Congratulations aRun a Day👍� you chose this path to scale new heights😊
[16/11/18, 10:10:19 AM] Kedar Gadgil: I think my question is being misunderstood. I am asking if it is ever possible to add a co-founder after actually founding the company and if it is possible to pay this person a salary like an employee...And still succeed.

Because to me, if you have to scout for paid co-founders, you've already failed.

That's why I asked for specific success stories. I believe there'll be none.
[16/11/18, 10:11:38 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): A run a day keeps the doctor away.. 😷
[16/11/18, 10:12:22 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): Pretty much agree to this..
[16/11/18, 10:12:37 AM] Amit Rawat: A Co-Founder can be brought after forming company but for that The board has to approve and documents changed.The founding team isn't supposed to get paid usually. It happens after some time depending the goals set & achieved
[16/11/18, 10:13:24 AM] Rohan Shah(ps): I too want to understand this
[16/11/18, 10:15:08 AM] Amit Rawat: I meet aspiring & 1st time entrepreneurs a lot and these are just some of the many queries i solve for them
[16/11/18, 10:23:23 AM] ‎You added Elaine FW
[16/11/18, 10:34:28 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Healthy discussion ☺️☺️
[16/11/18, 10:35:15 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @919623032945 I understood what you are trying to say here but everyone is not that lucky to get a cofounder from the start, isn’t it?
[16/11/18, 10:35:23 AM] Adit Chouhan (ps): With u on that Kedar. The core value that a co-founder shud bring to the table for me is 'passion'. If s/he is not as or more passionate than i am, it breaks my heart giving any equity to such a guy. 

Moreover, is it worth the adjustments u will have to make with another stakeholder to discuss with everytime before taking a decision. It slows down decision making for me too.

I feel there aren't really any quotable success stories of such hired or scouted co-founders coz they don't exist. The fire, the passion a co-founder needs to have usually isn't available on hiring basis. And, i am for one against getting a co-founder unless i see that s/he shares my vision with hard work n passion.
[16/11/18, 10:36:54 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What should they do? Stop looking for one?
[16/11/18, 10:38:16 AM] Neeraj Joshi: You never know. What is the actual story. Success stories are usually framed
[16/11/18, 10:39:24 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): well said... and i strongly agree with your second point...if you have a co-founder who disagrees with you on everything its a major bottleneck to doing good work...
[16/11/18, 10:40:01 AM] Adit Chouhan (ps): Yup
[16/11/18, 10:40:19 AM] Adit Chouhan (ps): Unnecessary wastage of time in discussions n debates
[16/11/18, 10:40:49 AM] Adit Chouhan (ps): If u r alone u own ur success as well as failures
[16/11/18, 10:42:15 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha! Lol! Debates and discussion are never a wastage of time if done on a relevant topic with right people. It might not be useful for you as u already know abt it, but might be useful for one in 181 pushstarters here

[16/11/18, 11:25:42 AM] Dimple (ps): There are two types, saying this from a recruitment point of view : Co-founder you don't pay salary and a co founder you pay salary. Any person who is salaried is doing a job simple as that.  Selection process only happens on trust factor. Trust factor also is divided in two steps : one is referral,  other is a long procedure of interview if you clear all rounds and fit the bill -you make it.  Simple as that.  I am into people business (recruitment) since 10plus years been on both sides of the table as corporate HR and recruitment consultant, run my own self funded recruitment firm and cater Pan India and work from mid to leadership level positions and cater to start-ups up-to global giants.  
I believe You can not define things in a certain manner and tell it this is how it is done. Most People use fancy labels and fancy designations just to feel they belong somewhere .also different companies have different selection process to make you win those labels.  It was a healthy discussion here am glad I posted a job here. 

However looking forward for referrals and applications. 

Thanks in advance.
[16/11/18, 11:43:33 AM] Dimple (ps): By two types I also mean one who is on fixed salary plus equity and some percentage. And no. 2 is one who is a part of profit and loss sharing and percentage. . I have been able to recruit/place a CTO at the salary of 40lakhs plus some percentage in Chennai won't disclose company name am sorry but this was a well funded startup. Also been able to recruit just tech product manager in a Hyderabad based company at 79lakhs plus equity ..this was a 500plus ppl mnc
Different companies have different procedures to select and choose and to allow you to win that fancy label and designation.  The roles you will perform there is also decided either by the board of members if the startup/company has or the director or founder himself. 

Have you ever read a line in job descriptions "work not limited to" .not limited to means you will have to do more work which even they aren't able to define it right now. . Hope this information helps.
[16/11/18, 11:47:12 AM] Dimple (ps): Also I am defining this from a recruitment point of view(people person) since I cater to start-ups up-to global giants.
[16/11/18, 11:50:29 AM] Adit Chouhan (ps): 👏🏻

[19/11/18, 7:54:01 AM] Sanjeev H: Successful people *don't shy away from accepting responsibility when they fail*...they just double down on their efforts...they *find a new way* if they need to. They learn the lesson and they make sure they turn it into a blessing. How you show up every day...is a choice. How you respond to wrongdoing - is your choice. *You can use events as excuses and let them ruin your life...or you can use them as motivation and strengthen your life*. No matter at what stage of life we are in, each one of us is a self-made man... *we are created by our choices*. It's our choice that fashions our path, any other explanation is an excuse. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and very good care of yourself.

We at TRAIL-iQ help mfg companies weed out counterfeits and ensure integrity in their supply chains and distribution networks - with the help of our propitiatory solution based on the blockchain technology.

I'm glad to be part of this group and looking forward towards a mutually rewarding engagement.

Cheers!

[19/11/18, 2:50:46 PM] ‪+91 95957 86858‬: Its an imported material. Its called buffed vegan leather - It changes colour over time/with use. It gets darker.
[19/11/18, 2:54:12 PM] Ishita (ps): Thanks.. I asked because I am working with groups that promote eco-friendly everything. But we support local products and preferably plant based, as these have least environmental footprint
[19/11/18, 2:54:16 PM] Arunaday Basu (ps): I will definitely order one and check out the product.. Seems interesting.. And will solve a lot of the problems associated with the animal leather industry..
[19/11/18, 2:55:50 PM] Arunaday Basu (ps): And if PETA is endorsing it then it must be interesting to try out at least..

[19/11/18, 6:24:07 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: Good Evening All!

My name is Kaustubh Mantri and I am the Co Founder of *The Health Connoisseur Foods Pvt Ltd*

The company was founded with the intention of making healthy food main stream.

We cater to the market through two of our brands:

*Mumma's Box* (www.mummasbox.com) which focuses on providing nutritious and healthy meals for school going children.

This is a unique service where we deliver freshly prepared tiffins at your home, starting at 6.00 am! 
It's a small way of helping all the working mothers and parents get a little more sleep instead of having to wake up at 5.00 am to cook food!

We cater to the B2C market via early morning deliveries and B2B market via direct tie ups with schools for their Cafeterias.

We also have our second brand called *White Apron* under which we provide institutional catering to Corporates. 

We currently have esteemed brands like Euroschool and IBM that we cater to in Pune.

Looking forward to network with this wonderful group!

Regards

[19/11/18, 7:03:42 PM] Ishita (ps): This is a wonderful concept. For those of you into health food startups, it will be wonderful if you can use vegetables and grains grown by natural sustainable farmers. I can connect you with suppliers of produce from authentic farmers who grow food that is safe for consumers and safe for the soil, no toxic fertilizers, pesticides or GMO seeds. It doesn't even cost more as is the perception
[19/11/18, 7:03:57 PM] ‪+91 91588 58989‬: Hi everyone, my name is Vivek Rao.  I'm the founder of Readify, a digital publishing house based in Pune and Mumbai. 

We currently have one Android app out, on which we have published novels, novellas and short story collections by new as well as established authors. 

We are now entering new-age storytelling formats, beginning with a new app (Android as well as iOS) dedicated to chat fiction, which we will be launching by December end. Chat fiction has done fabulously in western markets.  We hope to replicate the same in India. 

We are also working on other new formats, which will hopefully make reading cool and attractive again, especially among the younger audiences.  

Happy to be connected here.  🙂
[19/11/18, 7:07:43 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: Thank you!

[20/11/18, 1:51:42 PM] ‪+91 91588 58989‬: Hey, so sorry for the late reply. I'm unwell and not checking messages regularly.

Chat fiction is a form of storytelling where the whole narration happens by way of an exchange of chat messages between the characters.

It's as if you are able to peek into the mobile phone screen of one of the characters and read the conversations.

As an author and publisher I've observed that the tendency to read has been declining steadily, especially among younger audiences. Add to that the problems of reducing attention spans and easy availability of on-demand video for instant gratification.

Though chat fiction is not "literature", it presents the following benefits:

- It is very short; a story can be read in 4-5 minutes

- It is interactive in nature, this keeps you engaged

- There's a high element of multimedia involved, which creates an immersive reading experience. For example, while you are reading a story, images and sound effects will pop up.

I hope this answers your question.
🙂

CHEERS!
[24/11/18, 7:09:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!                                                                           

Feel free to Personally Msg me in case of any queries! 

Cheers!

[24/11/18, 8:47:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes it’s Alok Kejriwal
[24/11/18, 8:47:34 PM] Neeraj Joshi: How many of you guys know abt him?

[24/11/18, 8:49:14 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hehe! @919628509850 will be clear after the AMA
[24/11/18, 8:49:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Lets prepare some good questions ;)

[24/11/18, 9:08:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Nice

[24/11/18, 9:51:36 PM] Tarun (ps): Guys, one request. Let's stop silly talks and maintain the level of this group. As a startup, one should be looking to learn from successful entrepreneurs rather than discussing his/her personal things. Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi doesn't really matter.
[24/11/18, 9:54:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Its ok. No one is judging. Just a lite conversation sirji :)
[24/11/18, 9:54:21 PM] Tarun (ps): 😊
[24/11/18, 9:54:40 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Not the BNI kind of community 😆
[24/11/18, 9:54:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We take it litely

[24/11/18, 11:50:23 PM] Arunaday Basu (ps): Yes please..
[25/11/18, 12:00:39 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Agree. Venture matters
[25/11/18, 12:29:43 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): Is BNI too formal? #justasking cause I had got an invite to attend a meeting with them here in Pune.. What put me off was Tuesday 7.30am.. That's the meet time.. Insane.. For startups at least..
[25/11/18, 12:30:11 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes toooook formal and strict :)
[25/11/18, 12:31:01 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): Haha alright.. I don't have blazers also 💀
[25/11/18, 1:49:03 AM] Ishan Talathi (ps): If you join them, it is every Tuesday 7.30am
[25/11/18, 2:26:01 AM] Amit Rawat: With all due respect except for contacts BNI , Rotaract etc don't have much for Startups...
[25/11/18, 2:31:44 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Every Group has their own Decorum 👌 😇 which they Build over Time, as a Culture for all their members to follow too .

If a Startup Has to eventually Transform Into a Business,  these Meetups are Good,  as such Everyone has to start those Some Day! ☺ ✌👍✅

It helps in Networking,  them be it even a. Small group meeting or some large paid event too,  depends in what Stage anyone is at That time and How they Capitalise on the Connections so Found,  Maintained and Nurtured.
[25/11/18, 2:34:04 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): To Each their own
[25/11/18, 2:35:54 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): ✌🏻
[25/11/18, 2:36:37 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): Yeah I mean at least the meet up timings could be better? 🙃
[25/11/18, 2:37:12 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Business people have to be in their offices by 9 Nine or 10 max right?
[25/11/18, 2:37:34 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): These invite meeta are only doe 1.5hrs ☺ 😇✌✅
[25/11/18, 2:38:43 AM] Amit Rawat: Aspiring entrepreneurs, 1st time entrepreneurs need to attend Startup, workshops/meetups dealing with idea Validation/ techdev/fin/etc to learn about various asptects of entrepreneurship. Once they are into business then they can decide to enter business groups as per their needs / requirement etc.
[25/11/18, 2:39:02 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Moreover,  One Size don't fit all,  hence so many Groups are formed! Take your Pick no hassles,  compulsions too,  Try toh karo 👌 👍
[25/11/18, 2:39:29 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Bulls Eye 🎯
[25/11/18, 2:39:54 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): You made it shorter and concise Thank You ☺👍
[25/11/18, 2:40:11 AM] Amit Rawat: Been there done that so have many of my startups. Anyways leave to individuals to decide their own course. 👍🏻
[25/11/18, 2:40:13 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Each stage differs at growing levels...
[25/11/18, 2:40:35 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Share With you on that 👊👍✅😇
[25/11/18, 2:45:22 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Rawat Sahab,  if anytime come towards Mumbai do ping,  can catchup... 
Chai pe yaad taza kar lenge ☺ 👌
[25/11/18, 2:45:36 AM] Arunaday Basu (ps): Hopefully we will see PushStart growing into something which is interesting for all kinds of businessmen to come and join.. We'll make them come into our fold and style.. It'll be interesting to see that..
[25/11/18, 2:46:19 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): 😉PS, Would have it's own RULES too... 🤭
[25/11/18, 3:35:52 AM] Neeraj Joshi: After the curation we are currently
Focusing on the mid stage. Not too early for idea validation works and not too late for just business contacts ☺️☺️
[25/11/18, 3:36:09 AM] Neeraj Joshi: *workshops
[25/11/18, 3:36:52 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I believe it should be the combination of both: relevant knowledge and business connections.
[25/11/18, 3:39:34 AM] Neeraj Joshi: It is very difficult to cater to the demands of all stages of entrepreneurship
[25/11/18, 7:19:14 AM] Amit Rawat: 👍🏻

[26/11/18, 8:06:36 AM] Sanjeev H: When U R one among the less than 1% of the total population who has the *COURAGE* to follow his *PASSION*, his *DREAMS*...someone who is not scared of *DEFYING SOCIAL NORMS*, who is not scared of *FAILURE*, who is not willing to give up, and someone who is purposeful and decisive...YOU KNOW FOR SURE THAT *YOUR FIGHT WILL NOT BE EASY*. The majority...99% of the population will never let you walk your journey...they will always try to pull you down...pull you back to their average level of living...their average level of thinking. They will do everything possible to *BLOCK YOU*. They will *MOCK YOU*. They will *HUMILIATE YOU*. They will try to break you - psychologically and emotionally. 
I know it is difficult to sail against the wind. It is hard to swim against the tide. It is impossible not to get scared by the sound of thunder. *Those who are brave enough to do the difficult...to do the impossible...often reach the heights no one has ever dared to think*. No matter what your dreams are...no matter what your passion is....never ever give-up. *Be the person you always wanted to be*. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and  take good care of yourself.

And, as i mentioned to u earlier as well, u must do some thoughtful due diligence before judging people in the group. Loose comments like these r disrespectful n should be written carefully unless u feel u have some bunch of unprofessionals here.

For me, i would say that i have had enuf of this. So, stepping out of the group. Wish u guys a lot of success and growth. Do keep a bigger heart for sure.

Cheers..!!

You are free to leave if you can’t agree to the rules

[26/11/18, 5:52:29 PM] Tarun (ps): Friends, that was exactly my point a couple of days when I tried to stop any conversation related to Religion and all. When some people take offense of such a small thing, then you never know of other points. Also, rather than calling the "Rules", let's call them, "Guidelines". Let's all suggest in a proper way the guidelines. Once finalized we could publish it. Let's make it a collaborative and productive group where we help each other grow and keep ourselves away from any conflicts. My 2 cents

[28/11/18, 12:00:57 AM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: _Hey Thanks Bhavik._

Hello Guys,
I'm Vishal Adsool, the Founder CEO of a 8 year old tech company called Equations Work and the innovator of DIY VR platform called Experizer. Have been in the IT industry for over 16 years now and am looking forward to have some excellent conversations here. 🙏🏻Currently living and working out of Bavdhan area of Pune.
[28/11/18, 12:04:33 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Woah! You are doing some awesome work brother
[28/11/18, 12:05:26 AM] Neeraj Joshi: So any content I give can be immersed? @919822111619 ?

Wish you Good Luck! 👍✅

[28/11/18, 12:06:02 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @919822066390 @917767811021 you guys should check this out
[28/11/18, 1:35:53 AM] Pankaj Wahane (pspune): I have been working with Vishal Adsool's company for more than 3 years on various projects - sometimes in a customer-client relationship and sometimes in collaborative vendors arrangement -  and have witnessed him growing an already significantly sized company to almost triple its headcount while serving customers including several big brands. His company works with cutting edge technologies and it's always a pleasure and excitement to visit his company which is very vibrant and a place full of energy and innovations. Being in software industry for a long time I have seen many software products but no demonstration did blow my mind away as much as `Experizer`. It is something that you would immediately want to use for your professional need (which you would instantly think of). I highly recommend all to who feel relevant to his work to associate with him. Even idea sharing and validation is time worth spending with him.
[28/11/18, 7:09:31 AM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: Thank you 😊
[28/11/18, 7:15:57 AM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: Yes, these VR experiences are immersive. Consider Experizer to be like a CMS for VR. Just add content! 😊
[28/11/18, 7:16:39 AM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: 🙏🏻Thank you Darshan
[28/11/18, 7:19:19 AM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: Yes. You can use a 360 image/video. If not available then try Panoroma image or a simple image and we convert it to a 360 experience.

Mlog 1:

4.4 billion years ago a single cell originated on earth with mere survival and reproductive skills. A billion years after that cells started self organising and formed variety of species. This species exchanged their biological knowledge to create more skillful organisms. And finally the whole process led to a product that is today's human that can possibly acquire any skill and do anything that's imaginable. Mother nature helped the evolution by letting the eco-system develop and flourish and served all the needs. With that analogy I reckon the goals or in hard terms the purpose of a group like Pushstarters.. 

I don't know how, but I can imagine it to become a self organising team that builds better products and services than a single mind can envision. I mean someday I would love to see an IOT startup monitoring farm produce and supplying delivery schedule to millet products manufacturing company, with and ERP system extended to provide continuous optimisation of supply chain and e-commerce experts making it easily available to consumers that use blockchain to determine genuinity of product, with all the digital marketing workforce using VR to advertise like it has never happened in media with AR startups providing apps where one can look at himself in his dream sized waist wearing that awesome one-piece specially hand crafted artistic wonder and subscribing to diet plan to fit in that with the training workforce indulging into development of content to provide skills that are required to realise a scenario like that.. All the entities required to do this were present in last meetup.. And of course how a certain kind of subscription surprises them with a flower or a customised experience as a gift depending upon the level of consumers engagement with possibly some freakonomics (suspense) strategy of extreme engagement..

I understand ideas are commodities and execution is not but somebody had to write space odyssey to grow artificial intelligence and spacecrafts into what they are today..

Let me know what are your thoughts on how we all can remain self-governed autonomous bussinesses and still produce something way larger than our individual products or services. What scaling means to you and where do you want to see this togetherness of our journey going. 

I am not sure if this stream of thoughts follows what we should be doing with our posting privileges on this group so please do correct and/or let's continue and stay tuned.

VStEP, a Viacom18 initiative for the startup community, is inviting startups to co-innovate and offer solutions for challenges being faced by the media industry today.


Currently open for applications, VStEP 2.0 will introduce participation from angel investors, industry experts and the VC community. 11 Problem Statements and 7 Focus Areas across various functions have been identified and outlined for startups to present solutions. While the ‘Focus Areas’ are broader aspects where the program seeks new suggestions and innovations from the startup ecosystem, the ‘Problem Statements’ are immediate and pertain to specific requirements of the businesses and are best solved through focused solutions.

The applications are open now.

[03/12/18, 8:47:49 AM] Sanjeev H: Be it in life or career, always be sure of *THREE* things - 
1) *Where do you want to reach?* - Set Goals which are measurable
2) *When do you want to reach?* - Set a Timeframe
3) *Start Walking - Start Doing*
In Coaching sessions when participants say, "I want to be successful"...I want to be happy...I want to be wealthy...I want to be a leader...etc"...often, my first question to them is, *"Define it"*. *Define Success. Define happiness. Define wealthy. Define leadership*. 
People without specific and measurable goals are wasting their time, resources, and life. 
No matter in what industry, or what profession you are, *unless you are aiming to be in Top-3, you are not aggressive enough...you are not running fast enough*. 
Lastly, the truth is, a plan with action will not take you anywhere. Your destination will remain a *"Dream Destination"*, if you are not taking steps to reach there. 
So, start walking towards your goals. *Believe in yourself. Believe in your journey. Believe in yourself. Because, unless you believe in what you are doing, no one else will*. 
Have a fantastic week ahead and very good care of yourself. 
*[Snippets from the diary of Sanjeev Himachali]*

[03/12/18, 7:31:17 PM] Pankaj Wahane (pspune): Good Evening Push starters! 

The cognitive and purpose side of the mind do not remain isolated in separate compartments but intertwine and inte aazract in close correlation. Emotional predilections influence views and views determine predilections. Thus the penetrating view of nature of existence, gained through deep reflection and validated through investigation, brings with a restructuring of values which sets the mind moving towards goals commensurate with new vision. The application of mind needed to achieve those goals is what is meant by right intention. - The Buddha

Intent + Inspiration + desperation = Passion

And only passion can create great products..

Imagine a guy who was researching brain waves and analyzing the patterns of those waves. He was getting success day by day in his experiments and was completely lost in his research, so much so that he forgot his routine. He often forgot to eat and sometimes he forgot to go back home and spent his nights in the lab. One day he went home and his wife served him dinner. She usually would talk about her day during the dinner but that day was different. She didn't say anything.

He didn't notice that she was not talking. After they were done they went to bed. He was about to kiss her goodnight when she asked "Do you love me?" and he replied quickly "yes, I do. I love you a lot.". She asked again "Do you really love me?". She usually used to stop after the first question and sleep but he sensed, that night was different. He said "darling, I love you so much that I can't stop thinking about you. Thanks for being in my life. You keep me inspired to work. You keep me desiring for more.". She asked "do you really think of me while you are working?". He said "yes I do, believe me I only keep thinking about you while I am researching this new thing that is keeping me busy now a days". She the said "I am not saying that I don't believe you but I want you to prove it".

For any ordinary person it could be extremely difficult to prove that he thinks about somebody all his time. But he was no ordinary person. He could read neural impulses in body, analyze them and find the exact pattern generated when he thinked of her. For reading these neural impulses he got a chip implanted in his wrist and become the first cyborg. This chip implanted in his body used to transmit the intensity of signals to his server which analyzed these signals for the pattern which was created when he used to think of her. Then the sever was connected over internet to a gateway at his home and sever could send commands to this gateway which was in turn connected to a small circuitry in a necklace that had a blue LED that glowed when it got signal from gateway.

He gifted the neckalce to his wife and after that he never had to prove his love again. His love vas visual and glowing near her heart every now and then. That was the first of its kind Internet of Things (IoT) and the algorithm for extraction of feelings from a brain ways was quite advanced to today's AI standards. 

This also created a market for cheaters and most of these can be found tindering now a days..

This is how it happens.. look back at your product and see if desperation or inspiration is missing for intent can't be. If not be confident that it will prove your love.

(Irrelevant for I am not a techie - lame.. don't ever again introduce yourself like that. They could not fit it in a room, then they put it on your desks and laps.. then they went ahead and put it in your pocket and palms and by 2025 they will place it adjecent to your blood cell for sure. Be and remain interested)

Moreover,  This could be a crowded place then being Lonavala too...

[04/12/18, 1:49:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: People who have built networks from scratch and made a lot of money out of it would be preferable ☺️
[04/12/18, 1:49:28 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Talking about business networking here :)
[04/12/18, 1:49:28 PM] Batman (pushstart): BNI :D
[04/12/18, 1:49:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes I think we should call someone from there
[04/12/18, 1:49:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We pushstarters don’t know how to network :(
[04/12/18, 1:50:01 PM] Batman (pushstart): check the local ED
[04/12/18, 1:56:05 PM] Aditi (ps): BNI is a business / sales game to some extent.. I don't consider BNI as networking..
[04/12/18, 1:57:34 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes it’s a little bit hardcore
[04/12/18, 1:57:58 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Focus is on just sales and nothing else
[04/12/18, 1:58:37 PM] Batman (pushstart): It's networking extremism!
[04/12/18, 2:11:20 PM] Aditi (ps): It's a sales strategy ..
[04/12/18, 2:12:08 PM] Sunil (ps): Does the person's network has to be in India?
[04/12/18, 2:12:17 PM] Neeraj Joshi: No necessarily bro
[04/12/18, 2:12:44 PM] Sunil (ps): I have done this then. All my network is only outside India.

[04/12/18, 10:05:48 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): It is not at all a sales game but purely a networking art. If you can master it it's your victory.
[04/12/18, 10:06:13 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): Who said?

I have learnt so many other valuable lessons beyond sales, rather before sales
[04/12/18, 10:09:14 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): It's very easy to criticize someone else. There is crores of business people do and it's a combination of efforts and skills 

A network or opportunity may work for some and not for some based on your own interests, adaptability and investments.

It's never a good style to criticize any network if 
1. You have never been part of it
2. Been part of it but didn't work for you

Always better to say it didn't work for me for so and so reasons 

Why to generalise your opinion
[04/12/18, 10:09:50 PM] Dimple (ps): It's networking not willingly. Its process is too rigid.  Rigid meetings twice thrice a week one on one.  Compulsion on giving someone a referral
[04/12/18, 10:09:53 PM] Dimple (ps): To belong
[04/12/18, 10:10:08 PM] Dimple (ps): I don't find bni that useful. It doesn't have that ethos.
[04/12/18, 10:10:31 PM] Dimple (ps): I believe when things aren't done willingly or without trust it doesn't last longer
[04/12/18, 10:10:49 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): I had done a session for SLP fellows on networking by the executive director himself and it was the best learning feedback we ever got

SLP stands for startup leadership program
[04/12/18, 10:11:02 PM] Dimple (ps): That Rigid thanking speeches and dressing up and overspending money in 5stars
[04/12/18, 10:11:14 PM] Dimple (ps): I don't personally like their concept
[04/12/18, 10:11:22 PM] Aditi (ps): Thanks Reshma.. but Bni Definitely is not networking.. 
There is a difference between what Bni does and what networking stands for..
[04/12/18, 10:11:32 PM] Dimple (ps): True that
[04/12/18, 10:12:05 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): Have you been a member and how long?
[04/12/18, 10:12:06 PM] Aditi (ps): Also speaking and giving a session on networking is different from actually networking...
[04/12/18, 10:12:25 PM] Dimple (ps): Absolutely
[04/12/18, 10:13:00 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): Why so
[04/12/18, 10:13:35 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): I completely disagree. You cannot do business if you can't network or don't know how to build relationships
[04/12/18, 10:13:49 PM] Tarun (ps): Dimple and Aditi, with due respect I think you guys have a totally wrong perseption of BNI.
[04/12/18, 10:13:50 PM] Aditi (ps): Reshma I would never be a member of an organisation whose thos of which I don't abide by.. 

The number of people who have asked me to come for an early morning breakfast / membership  and pay for it it self is a negative factor..
[04/12/18, 10:14:28 PM] Aditi (ps): Alright.. BNI rocks. But thanks :)
[04/12/18, 10:15:00 PM] Tarun (ps): And that's very interesting. Let's catch-up sometime. Want to understand your perseption.
[04/12/18, 10:16:12 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): Why negative. Do you mean everything that is free is only valuable and positive

How do you value a free service
[04/12/18, 10:16:26 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): That's a definitely negative attitude now
[04/12/18, 10:16:27 PM] Aditi (ps): The process and strategy of the founder is commendable though. And the support BNI could give a member is amazing too. But it's not networking..
[04/12/18, 10:16:58 PM] Tarun (ps): Aditi, now that's rigidness. You are judging an International organisation just because they called you early morning and asked you for meeting fees?
[04/12/18, 10:16:59 PM] Dimple (ps): Bni rocks but thanks. I don't want to attend meetings at 7ish or meet people every week all the time. Looking at same faces all the time is more of a social gathering not effective networking. Asking someone to give you a referral just bcoz u r a part of community is not what I as a person follow..  I don't give refs of anyone unless I personally work with them and trust that person.
[04/12/18, 10:17:09 PM] Dimple (ps): The intentions of bni would be great
[04/12/18, 10:17:21 PM] Dimple (ps): But the process is too rigid and not networking in my eyes
[04/12/18, 10:17:56 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): Again repeating, do not criticize if you haven't experienced it or liked it. Just like each human being is different from the other and has its own persona , each network has its own value which clicks with the person who is aligned with it
[04/12/18, 10:18:17 PM] Tarun (ps): That's your personal problem. Don't spread negativity in the group just because you can't wake up early.
[04/12/18, 10:19:09 PM] Dimple (ps): I sure do and I sure can wake up early . It's just not networking in my opinion.  But thanks.
[04/12/18, 10:19:36 PM] Aditi (ps): I value free services very highly.. If coming with the right attitude and from genuine folks... 
And you know it best... SLP organises workshops but doesn't pay the workshop host. :P
[04/12/18, 10:19:39 PM] Sanjay (ps): Guys 
Can you please take this discussion offline.
[04/12/18, 10:20:40 PM] Aditi (ps): Yup.. was about to say that.. we can meet and figure... :)
[04/12/18, 10:20:43 PM] Reshma Sagari (ps): It's a not for profit and BNI and or businesses are for profits

The two are separate entities with separate goals hence separate models
[04/12/18, 10:21:24 PM] Tarun (ps): Great. Dimple and Aditi, when are we meeting?
[04/12/18, 10:21:35 PM] Tarun (ps): Weekends?

[09/12/18, 2:05:45 PM] Mayur (ps): I have transparent charging model. I'll charge digital marketing executive's salary plus my managing fees.

So it becomes customizable. As different ventures need different components (some need more SEO then social, some need emails more than anything and so on), traditional "fixed plans" don't pan out well.
[09/12/18, 2:07:07 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Quite interesting
[09/12/18, 2:17:32 PM] Mayur (ps): ... *than social...
[09/12/18, 2:17:52 PM] Keerthi Kadam: Want to know an approximate number so that it can be budgeted...how much is the salary+ managing fees? Sorry if I am being straight forward. You can ignore this if you don't want to answer 🙂
[09/12/18, 2:24:33 PM] Mayur (ps): I'd love to answer but it feels like "how much a car costs" right now
😅
Of course I want to sell great cars but have to know your exact needs to begin that.

Say novice SMM DM exec charges 8k/pm in Nashik (my team works from Nashik, I manage from Pune). Add to that my 20% managing fees. You have monthly charge for one.
SEO exec charges 10-12k.
But this can change drastically if you need someone Pune based and/or well experienced and afford it.
Or you may need each one for 15 days only. Or SEO for 15, SMM for full month.
So it's calculated based on work weeks you need and their salary.
[09/12/18, 2:26:56 PM] Keerthi Kadam: Thanks so much ... appreciate it. Maybe next month we'll get your service. 🙂
[09/12/18, 2:27:19 PM] ‪+91 91588 58989‬: How much for a pune based, experienced exec?

This is a *lifestyle*. It's not a gimmick or quick fix. There is no magic band. 
Just try and find me an example of a truly successful person who doesn't do self-work daily? You can't. They don't exist. The magic band does not exist. *If U want a great life...you'll do the daily work to create one*. It's not sexy. It's not quick. It's not easy. It is just the TRUTH. Work on yourself. 
*If you're not committed to working on yourself...every day...no one can help you*. If you are committed to working on yourself...no one can stop you. Work...and the results will come. *Make a commitment to be one of the few who is obsessed with growing...obsesses with getting better every day*.

[10/12/18, 11:46:51 AM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Fyniti is a US based company with offices in Dallas and Chennai. They are currently looking for a Senior Web Developer, Senior Front end developer, and Platform back-end Developer. 

*The Annual CTC is between 10 L to 20 L* based on your experience and qualifications. Final salary can be negotiated with the value that you can bring to the company. 

*Please note that this will be my direct referral* and this means that I put a major emphasis that nothing happens to my reputation and henceforth a little stingy on that. However, I still wish that the deserving should get this and such I would like to have a small talk with the people who would wish to apply for this position before I refer them. 

If any of you think any of your friends, family/relatives or yourself will be a perfect fit for the role, please ask them to write me a personal mail to contactsv1996@gmail.com

Thanks. I am sending the JD along with this.

[10/12/18, 1:49:00 PM] Kedar Gadgil: How many people knew about this? https://winatlinkedin.com/linkedin-engagement-pods/

I am sure there are groups that do the same for other social media. For example, if there are 500 members here on Pushstarters, just in Pune, we could create a way in which there could be enhanced engagement on each others' company posts on various social media (perhaps a new Whatsapp group as a subset of this group can be formed for those interested).

For example, when I post about a new launch of my jam flavours, at the moment, I cannot afford to pay for boosting the post, but if say, 100 people on a closed group of 500 were to Like, share, and comment on it, suddenly, it will receive an algorithmic boost.

Do I want to to try this out? For sure. Do I feel uncomfortable about it? Actually, I do. It is fake engagement. But is there a better way to boost one's SM posts without giving FB or LI or Tw money (in which case, they do exactly what I am proposing, but get paid for it)? I don't know.

Another way of approaching this would be if someone here built an app that would allow companies like mine to pay for each like and share (something ridiculously small, say, 5 paisa for a like or 10 paisa for a share), and people could just join and leave at voluntarily, and keep accumulating money which can then get paid at some point, either through hard cash or through some kind of vouchers, I think it would make for an interesting idea...if something like this doesn't already exist.
[10/12/18, 3:03:21 PM] Akshay Patil (ps): I support this
[10/12/18, 3:05:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I had started this long time back. It’s easy to start but difficult to keep up the commitment

[10/12/18, 3:09:14 PM] Kedar Gadgil: I understand, and I see the problems. That is why I was wondering if there was a straight up app that helped people get points, convertible to money or vouchers...that'd help solve it
[10/12/18, 3:11:10 PM] Neeraj Joshi: There are a lot of apps for twitter/insta where you can buy likes and comments
[10/12/18, 3:11:19 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: this is something in the grey area technically.. there are a lot of paid 'Click Farms' available which can generate likes for you and get the engagement levels up..

[10/12/18, 3:15:13 PM] Kedar Gadgil: A Hindustan Lever can always outspend a Tasha & Girl, even if we have better content
[10/12/18, 3:15:28 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Ditto distribution. Cash is needed there.
[10/12/18, 3:15:29 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: like the others pointed out.. unless there is some amount of monetary or other form of reward involved, its difficult to sustain such groups for a long time.. it comes down to basic human behaviour..
[10/12/18, 3:16:09 PM] Kedar Gadgil: I know...That's why I asked if someone's built something that gamifies it and smaller brands like mine can utilise it
[10/12/18, 3:16:19 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: but if somebody does solve the problem in a transperant manner, they will likely be helping a lot of people!
[10/12/18, 3:16:39 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: i would also sign up for it immediately
[10/12/18, 3:16:44 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: 😊
[10/12/18, 3:16:49 PM] Kedar Gadgil: 👍🏽
[10/12/18, 3:18:21 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: i guess social media influencers have a job because this hasnt yet been cracked...
[10/12/18, 3:19:02 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Thanks Neeraj :)
[10/12/18, 3:19:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: But if it gets famous, platforms will crack it down. Don’t you guys think?
[10/12/18, 3:19:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: You will be taking away their revenue in that sense
[10/12/18, 3:20:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Which you would have used in paid ads
[10/12/18, 3:20:46 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: yup.. true.. inherently the idea can never get too big.. it will have to stay under the radar to avoid being sidelined
[10/12/18, 3:22:18 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Let's see if we can write the specs for it:
1. Build something that can automate a rating for my influence (a la Klout).
2. Use that score to throw my hat into the ring, giving my preferences and qualifications (example: I like sport but not badminton, I love animals but not cats, I like to run but not professionally, etc), and offering each of my interactions for a sum of money to companies/brands that fit into my criteria.
3. Brands may bid. Whoever wins gets promoted by me for as long as I want and the brand can pay, and then the cycle begins. My simple participation in this game increases my rating, for example, thus incentivising my participation.

I agree that the APIs for this would come under threat the moment the biggies know of it...also, they'd change their algos...but, it is not very difficult to do this offline with an online component. Check out http://woop.world for example.
[10/12/18, 3:22:20 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: so it brings us back to the original ques.. that there probably isnt a clear transparent way of generating engagement without paying for it!
[10/12/18, 3:23:08 PM] Kedar Gadgil: I didn't say I won't pay for it...I said I'd rather pay the person who engages than a middle man...I don't mind paying the middleman too, but only a small percentage. Most of my money should go to the person engaging.
[10/12/18, 3:23:35 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: fair enough
[10/12/18, 3:23:49 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Anyway, as many pointed out, this is moot. Let me know if anyone can create something like this or if there already exists something I can use and be able to sleep at night 🙂. Till then, ladate raho!
[10/12/18, 3:24:22 PM] ‪+91 99101 92096‬: 😊👍🏼
[10/12/18, 3:24:24 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Like an Uber for Engagement 😉
[10/12/18, 3:24:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Commends on this @919623032945 ?
[10/12/18, 3:25:10 PM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: Back in 2010-2011, a system like this existed. I am trying to recollect the name.
[10/12/18, 3:25:39 PM] Kedar Gadgil: I did...
[10/12/18, 3:26:04 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Here are my comments on that @918779219493 "I agree that the APIs for this would come under threat the moment the biggies know of it...also, they'd change their algos...but, it is not very difficult to do this offline with an online component. Check out http://woop.world for example."
[10/12/18, 3:30:18 PM] ‪+91 98221 11619‬: Also hypothetically saying if a CEO of a Jam company posts and a lot of techies like it, the post would be shown to a lot of other techies possibly in the same region and their likes would be monitored too. This would necessarily mean the further audience you'd get may or may not be the right kind, probably defying the purpose of your post.
[10/12/18, 3:36:17 PM] Kedar Gadgil: As I said, there are online-offline models to make this happen. If someone is seriously interested, I could join in the brainstorming and perhaps contribute something of interest. I gave an example of Woop in my previous comment. They are my friends. Check them out.

[13/12/18, 2:45:32 AM] Neeraj Joshi: How is this relevant here? 😂😳
[13/12/18, 8:37:28 AM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: Hey guys,
Good morning.

I got some questions regarding digital marketing.
What is a good conversion rate for an online ad?
Also when you say conversion, is it lead(sign up)? Or is it purchase?
Than
[13/12/18, 8:39:28 AM] ‪+91 97765 04766‬: Conversion rate depends on niches, target audience, product etc. Varies. 

Conversion can be both- sign ups or purchase. Depends on your goal
[13/12/18, 8:50:18 AM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: So if I am getting a 5% conversion for sign up and 2% conversion for purchase for my eLearning product landing page, how to know if it is a hit or miss
[13/12/18, 9:01:46 AM] ‪+91 98811 94556‬: Unfortunately as per my experience there is no way of knowing whether the conversion on your landing page is from the Ad or not. Stats from landing page or Ad may give you some ideas but it can't tell for sure.
[13/12/18, 9:06:38 AM] Sunil (ps): Just use Pixel to track
[13/12/18, 9:07:16 AM] ‪+91 97765 04766‬: If you have a good substantial +ve ROI, it’s a hit. You can track your conversions using pixels and check if it’s from ads or organic.

[13/12/18, 5:04:55 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Push Starters, we are looking for someone who can loan us a card swipe machine for a day when we take part in a fair. www.tashaandgirl.com is taking part in the Infosys Annual Day on 22 December 2018 and we are renting a stall to showcase and sell our products. However, we do not have a card swipe machine and honestly, need it so rarely that it makes no sense to invest in one. If someone has one spare, we can come to some commercial understanding for that one day's use. Please get in touch with me privately. Much appreciated. Thanks.
[13/12/18, 5:05:52 PM] Rajneesh BAF (ps): Get it from mswipe... fastest way to get

[16/12/18, 12:35:53 PM] Atijya (Pushstart): Hi guys,

Could someone get me in touch with a few communities/groups in Kolkata for an event I'm organizing -- for a collaboration to get registrations? 

Brief of the event attached below. 

Thanks a ton. 😇
[16/12/18, 12:35:55 PM] Atijya (Pushstart): People of Kolkata. We're organizing our first version of Safe Space Initiative : Chapter 1 in Kolkata. 

A one of a kind event to gather people under one roof and have an intimate and honest conversation around mental health. 

Date 📅 : 7th January, 2019

Time 🕧 : 3-7 pm. 

*WHAT'S THE EVENT ABOUT?*

👣 Safe space where people gather together and share what they're going through in an intimate, vulnerable setting. 

👣 Blindfolded, everyone will get a chance to be themselves and not be judged for it. 

👣 Ten minutes to speak their hearts out. 

👣 No advice. No feedback. No judgment. 

*WHO SHOULD ATTEND THE EVENT?*

 👍 Those who're tired of the endless pretense.

👍 Students, working professionals, the young, the old.

👍 Those who are sick of putting the best version of themselves online for the world to see and judge. 

👍 Those who have people around them but no real friends to share what they're going through. 

👍 Who don't want to be judged, told what to do, or shut down. 

👍 Those who're just tired of the endless stigma and judgment. 

👍 Those who want to just observe and revel in vulnerable and heartfelt conversations. 

We'll be ending with a reflection session in the end, quick food🍕🍲 and beverages 🍹☕ in between, and a warm and mighty hug before we part ways. 💕

The event is open to 25 people.

Normal registrations -- 300 rupees. 

Student registrations -- 200 rupees. 

To know more check out the event @ https://bit.ly/2QWY9OW

Or fill in the google form below and we'll get in touch with you. 

https://bit.ly/2zZiA4m

Let's together, celebrate what makes us real, different, special, and human. 

Enough of the stigma, ridicule, and pretense. 

Let's be real, together. ✊💪

[19/12/18, 4:22:14 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): What kind of clarity seeked? 
Guess this can be openly discussed to benefit all other members too... 

Let me know your queries
[19/12/18, 4:23:05 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): I wish to know:
1. What is your product (a little description) just FMI?
2. How did you find the right Instagram influencer for the same?
3. How was the engagement like, was it for the IG post or IG Story? The amount (if you can disclose) and anything in particular I need to remember?
[19/12/18, 4:31:15 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Apna batana chahiye ya mera pata Karna chahte ho🤷🏻‍♂ 😂 

....

Why I it you are. Looking to do with any influencer on instagram,  it varies maybe anymore the. Digital marketing people here can never ot too of you framed the query correctly... 

It differs from Influencer to influencer (rates results response and target audience) but what you need to get out of it has to be decided and fixed prior to engaging for goal results to be reached.
[19/12/18, 4:33:11 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Just one Influencer post may not be enough... 

You might have to run either parallel ones or tweak after the first and run the others conditionally,  targetingas per demographics selected per your required TG
[19/12/18, 4:35:33 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): I have read all this general information on many blogs, I wanted to know personal experiences, hence I pinged in the group.

[24/12/18, 8:28:52 AM] Sanjeev H: Whatever your goal may be - fitness, professional, relationship, or life goals, the key to success is - *PUSH YOURSELF*. Push yourself to do EXTRA. *It's this five-letter word, EXTRA, that turns ORDINARY into EXTRAORDINARY*. That EXTRA work of one hour...that EXTRA try of one more time...that extra attempt of TRYING IT DIFFERENTLY...has always and will always differentiate a successful person from unsuccessful one...differentiate a winner from a loser. *But that extra must come from within YOU*, because within you, you have the capability to be anything you want to be. Therefore, *be deaf to external noises...listen to the voice of your soul...stay focused...never giveup...and push yourself for one more time...until you reach your destination...until you reach your goal*.

If i m not wrong 😊
[25/12/18, 1:43:25 PM] Yuvraj (Pushstart): Yes, but that's this can be their sale's strategy, giving spaces for startups in co-working spaces and then generating leads. Focused crowd, so much area of advertisement and a hot dialing number on every desk for design needs. Business model maybe (just guessing).
[25/12/18, 1:50:55 PM] Harsha Kakeri (pushstart): Ok! Let me address this. 
DesignBoat has 3 Ventures.

1. DesignBoat UI/UX Studio

It's time to take a step back and THINK!

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

[26/12/18, 12:19:59 PM] ‪+91 98811 94556‬: Hello guys, my name is Vaidehi Vaidya. I remember sometime back there was a conversation about finding a co-founder. I have a couple of questions. 1. How do you find them? Are there portals to for that? If there are people on the group who have found co-founders, I would like their opinion. 2. Do you always have to pay them or is there any other system in place for example barter system. If so what are your experiences in such situations?
[26/12/18, 12:22:06 PM] ‪+91 98811 94556‬: I am guessing you don't just meet the co-founders right? It is a search?
[26/12/18, 12:23:39 PM] Jayesh (axonator): They arrange such events in Silicon Valley where people looking for co-founders attend.
[26/12/18, 12:24:39 PM] ‪+91 98811 94556‬: Do we have anything of sorts here?
[26/12/18, 12:24:46 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: What worked me in the past is co-founder dating event. We had one in Mumbai.
[26/12/18, 12:24:59 PM] ‪+91 70453 78980‬: IT was free

[26/12/18, 12:56:57 PM] Akshay Patil (ps): @918779219493 no doubt you have raised the community standard. But to convey the message you wanted to convey to an early startup should have created value which @919923406066 would have understood.

That reminds me of the concept someone brought how Social Media marketers could help other  community people at early stage
[26/12/18, 12:58:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Understood.
[26/12/18, 1:00:34 PM] Krishnaa Kantthawala- Smart Foods: Thank you Akshay
[26/12/18, 1:11:05 PM] Krishnaa Kantthawala- Smart Foods: A small piece of suggestion here. We don't know each other's business priorities. I have options to make awesome social media pages but thats not my priority right now. I've sold over 1200 pcs in 2 months since i started whithout any social media. And this link i shared was simply to direct people to Amazon. Thr would be companies with grt social media and no traction. Whats the point?  Lets be supportive of each others efforts rather than putting someone down just because you might be good at it 😊
[26/12/18, 1:11:51 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Lol! No one tried to put you down. We ask such questions to everyone
[26/12/18, 1:11:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Be it me, you are anyone else
[26/12/18, 1:12:12 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *or
[26/12/18, 1:13:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Such questions help like the way it did in this case. ❤ Let me know if it didn't
[26/12/18, 1:17:22 PM] Tarun (ps): Interesting question. Short answer is angel.co. Register there. Create your profile thoroughly and mention what you are looking for. Share the link here also so that we could also look into it and suggest.
[26/12/18, 1:17:57 PM] ‪+91 98811 94556‬: done!
[26/12/18, 1:20:28 PM] Tarun (ps): Yes agree with you and Neeraj both. But we all will improve. I think we all need to create our 1 page details page. Can be centralized. One page per member that we can update. Then asking questions, we can share that link so that others can understand and answer appropriately.
[26/12/18, 1:20:51 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): F6S is also a decent platform for this but I recommend using your own personal or professional network for doing so

[31/12/18, 8:26:26 AM] Sanjeev H: Today being the last day of the year, 2018, I want to share something about forgiveness. I understand when someone U care about hurts U, U can hold on to anger, resentment, & thoughts of revenge — or *embrace forgiveness and move forward*. I used to hold on to grudges before I understood the magic of forgiveness. *Forgiveness, I have learned, is a conscious, Deliberate Decision to release feelings of resentment or vengeance toward a person who has harmed U, regardless of whether they actually deserve UR forgiveness*”.
Being hurt by someone, particularly someone U love & trust, can cause anger, sadness, & confusion. *If U dwell on hurtful events or situations, grudges filled with resentment, vengeance, & hostility can take root*. U might find yourself swallowed up by UR own bitterness or sense of injustice.
As U LetGo of grudges, you'll no longer define UR life by how you've been hurt. U might even find compassion & understanding. Therefore, think of forgiveness more as healing *that can change UR life* — by bringing U peace, happiness, and emotional & spiritual healing. Forgiveness can take away the power of the other person to continue to wield in UR life. *Forgive, not because they deserve it, but because U deserve peace & harmony in UR life*.
Have a fantastic week ahead and take very good care of yourself.

[01/01/19, 1:11:08 AM] Pankaj Wahane (pspune): साल आये नया हज़ारो ख़ुशियाँ लेकर,
दूर आपसे हर ख़याल बुरा हो।
प्यार मोहब्बत का आसरा मिले,
और मंज़र आँखों के सामने सुहाना हो।
सुख दुःख में साथ हो आप के चाहने वाले और आपकी चाहत,
किसी मजबूरी का ना बहाना हो।
चलता रहे समय का पहिया यूँही,
और जाने वाला साल हँसी ख़ुशी रवाना हो।
चले ना अकेला ना कोई इंसान या जानवर,
सांग हमेशा साबके सारा ज़माना हो।

नए साल की शुभकामनाएँ!

पंकज वाहने और परिवार...

[01/01/19, 9:16:50 AM] ‪+91 98904 70074‬: Before Nelson Mandela left  prison he said "As I stand before the door to my freedom, I realize that if I do not leave my pain, anger and  bitterness behind me, I will still be in prison".


Self imprisonment is worse than that imposed.

 How many are in self inflicted pains today for lack of forgiveness. How many of us have imprisoned ourselves inside the walls of anger and bitterness. 

Holding grudges does not make you strong, it makes you bitter.

 Forgiveness does not make you weak, it sets you free.

Consider this while you are preparing to move into 2019

[03/01/19, 8:45:59 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Pune has been Mumbai’s satellite town for decades. But it looks like it has come of age for entrepreneurs. With an efficient startup ecosystem evolving, Pune is rising in health tech, SAAS, automobile, etc., although it lags behind the metros in terms of food tech and e-commerce.

https://yourstory.com/2016/08/pune-startups/
[03/01/19, 8:48:46 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): According to AngelList, Pune is home to a mind boggling 322 startups. Many among them, have been subject to big ticket acquisitions. TastyKhana is one such startup, which due to its rapid growth acceleration, initially invited massive investments and was subsequently acquired by Rocket Internet backed Global online food delivery marketplace FoodPanda. In a similar development, Buzzfactory, a social media & digital agency was acquired by a US based mobile technology company Qliktag Software Inc, after it made an early angel investment it. True Sparrow was another Pune-based startup that was acquired by Fab.com

[07/01/19, 8:09:02 AM] Sanjeev H: *Any purpose, any goal comes with the risk of utter defeat*. But it is at that moment when we are about to lose our footing...when our bodies are weak and minds are worn, we must fight the hardest or else risk losing everything. *Our passion to win must burn hotter than the sands beneath our feet*. Only by daring to step forward...does our mission to succeed begin. Always remember, *we are all gladiators in our own arena*. To endure the endless battle, the only helpful substance is raw strength of spirit and the iron will to never yield. 
Before we give in...before we let go of all we have trained for, remember the words etched on a warrior's heart, *"If I feel pain, I am alive. If I am alive, I can fight. If I can fight, I can win"*. 
Greatness is not handed down...it has never been handed down; it is forged in the hands of those wiling to fight for it. 
*Follow your dream. Follow your passion. And, never ever give up*. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and take very good care of yourself.

[08/01/19, 10:29:28 AM] Kedar Gadgil: I realised I haven't introduced myself here only after I wrote my introduction on PS FB channel. So, FWIW, here goes:
[08/01/19, 10:29:38 AM] Kedar Gadgil: Hello, everyone. My name is Kedar Gadgil. You can find more about me here: https://about.me/KedarGadgil 

I am an IAF brat, and was raised on various Air Force stations across India. I went to about 12 schools before clearing Std X (because of my father's job, not because I was a dunce!), and having rejected a career in the IAF (because only one of us brothers could go into the uniformed services, and my brother won the toss! That did not turn out very well for him unfortunately, as he lost his life in a MiG-21 air crash on 17 September 2001. A film was made on his crash and my family's subsequent battles with the government of the day, called Rang De Basanti. but that is another story), started my first business selling customised t-shirts to college students in 1990, when I was in my first year of Electrical Engineering from BVCOE, Pune.

From there on, I have started and run (some successfully and some not, while some being total washouts) about 28 businesses of my own from Australia, Hong Kong, India, UK, and USA, ranging from media, infotech, life sciences, aerospace, agriculture, trading, pharmaceutical, and realty, to outsourcing,  design, direct sales, consulting, finance, IP, and hardware. The last big job I had was running the IndoGlobal Group, a transnational entity having offices in 3 continents and employing over 300 people spread over 16 companies operating in independent verticals. I crashed spectacularly in 2008, when Lehman Brothers went down in flames, taking the whole world's economy (especially commodity markets) down with them. By 2011, I was completely bankrupt (my third since 1990) and going through a messy divorce. I picked up myself, met someone, got married, and started a new life in 2012, when I started consulting other startups.

Since then, I have been engaged by various new and old businesses to help them start, grow, and some even shut down.

In 2017, I entered a new business with my wife and my friend (Karthik), wherein we make jams using traditional recipes and without using any synthetic substance whatsoever and sell them domestically in niche places. The recipes belong to my wife (Natasha)'s great-grandmother who worked with English & Scottish women on the Assam tea estates in the early 20th century. You can see more about us here: www.tashaandgirl.com.

Here's a secret no one knows: Right from 1990, all through my life, I have applied for 1,000s of jobs, from janitors to CEOs, from marketing to design, and from real estate to infotech. I have made different types of CVs, tried recruitment agents and headhunters, registered on every new job site that came up (not just in India), and even gone for walk-in interviews. I have tried getting people to refer me, applied for jobs advertised in classifieds, and called up friends & family to beg them to employ me. To be fair, most of this has been done during my down phases (of which I have had plenty) and the last time I applied for a job was 8 years ago. However, that being said, the truth is this: The one and only reason I am in business is because no one offered me a job. Every time I was rejected, I went and did something entrepreneurial just to keep the home fires burning. I am not one of those who always wanted to be in business, or wanted to become the richest man in the world, or had any delusions about being my own boss or whatever. I literally went into business because I was not good enough for anything or anyone else.

What may I contribute to #PushStart? I have no clue. My own startup is still struggling, and I am out looking to find funds for it. My past is full of spectacular flameouts and ridiculously stupid mistakes. My education is nominal, and I am being euphemistic about it. My age is neither senior enough to be the worldly, wise man, nor young enough to be full of brash, fearless energy. So, franky, I am not sure what any PushStarter may want from me.

What do I want from PushStart? I do not know that too. It feels nice to be in the company of entrepreneurs. It feels nice to be part of a community of go-getters. It feels nice to belong to a bunch of dreamers who do more than just dream, but actually start working towards achieving those. Maybe someone here will help me find funding for my new venture. Maybe someone may become a customer or client. Maybe I might find lifelong friends. Maybe I might create professional relationships and run into future partners and suppliers. Or maybe someone will finally offer me a job so I can shut the fuck up about it at last. Yeah, right!
[08/01/19, 10:33:06 AM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): Welcome to the group, Kedar and you my friend is the perfect voice for the event I shared above. Kudos to the journey taken and cheers for the roads ahead

I am looking to get in touch with brands who wish to advertise within 400 NMMT buses. Brands can book as less as 3 buses to begin with.
This advertising media works brilliantly for fmcg products, real estate projects, jewellery brands, TV programs, to name a few. 
If you are a brand in the above segment or know brands who can benefit from it kindly connect :)

Thankyou have a great day!

*In these days of fake news, where negativity is coming to us from every possible direction*, #SmileGifters - A social impact startup from Gujarat, that I'm mentoring, is trying to encourage people to spread goodness and gift smiles. With the help of proven methodologies like Gamification, Design Thinking and concepts from Behaviourial Psychology, this young energetic startup team aims to a make positive dent, in their own small way. The idea is in concept testing stage where they're leveraging Instagram to test their hypotheses, before proceeding to develop  full fledged mobile and web apps. 

And they need your help to add more strength to their hands, so as to enable them to make a dent that's a bit larger. All that it would take is a few seconds of your time to follow their Instagram Handle - @smilegifters.

[14/01/19, 8:17:44 AM] Sanjeev H: In our day-to-day life, we come across numerous people. *Everyone is fighting a battle at a different level*. Each one is scripting a story. *They are working hard to make the best out of the choices available to them*. Be kind and empathetic to them. We have no right, whatsoever, to judge their choices and decisions. 
Instead of focusing on others and what they are doing, start focusing on yourself. Look within and improve yourself. *When we focus on improving ourselves...when we focus on our journey and our goals...everything and everyone around us appears harmless...everyone looks like a collaborator and a facilitator*. 
When we focus on others...when we focus on their journey...when we focus on their decisions and choices...everything and everyone around us appears to be a potential threat...a manipulator, who is trying to take advantage of us. *Everyone is harmless unless you enter into their territory...interfere in their way of living...and start analyzing a journey you have no clue about*. Mastering yourself is a key to the successful, meaningful and happy life. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and take very good care of yourself.

1. There's no harm as long as you don't dilute it and don't have to raise funds to create value.

2. Be more densed and concentrated in particular vertical or geography. A first few hundred organic leads is an indication to leave that space and explore newer ones.
[17/01/19, 10:54:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I didn’t get the last part of the 2nd point
[17/01/19, 10:54:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Can u elaborate?
[17/01/19, 10:58:12 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): As in let's assume you establish in a certain particular vertical or geography so that every tom, dick and harry is aware of pushstart for a common purpose.

When the demand rises, pushstart will not have to make efforts as the existing consumers will vouch and organic leads starts.

[18/01/19, 1:54:03 PM] Manjula Nair (ps): Friends, My first resolution of 2019 was to build my own blog site and start blogging regularly. In the last 4 years my company must have churned out over 10000 blogs for our clients in India & over seas, but never got the time to do my personal blogs. 2019 started off with my own writing. My Blogs have sections of Life's experience, Marketing (My core competency), Business ideas (For this section you can reach me and i can conduct your interviews), Social & endorsements. Please visit my site, read my first lot of blogs, Like, share, Comment and encourage me to write more. www.manjulanair.in

[18/01/19, 2:07:42 PM] Manjula Nair (ps): 🙏🏼 Leaders the mantra i followed here to make time for my personal initiative was to wake up an hour earlier and do the writing. Also carry a cheat book in ur bag to jot down ideas, incidents, people that you would like to write about later. I simply love this little change and feel empowered writing stuff that i like and passionate about.
[18/01/19, 2:09:05 PM] Manjula Nair (ps): So for my section Business Ideas, reach me so i can write about your business idea too

What's the idea about paying in USD by any indian payer,  to a company in India too? 

They'd need to have a Holding current account (comes additionally with the current account for forex) for the usd and has to show remittance too as a proof everytime foreign currency hits the account...

[21/01/19, 8:14:57 AM] Sanjeev H: *People live in the imprisonment of their past, their circumstances, and situations*. They love blaming others for their current state. That's probably the easiest thing to do. The real freedom, I have learned, is in taking the ownership of your life. The real freedom is in accepting and announcing, *"I am responsible for my choices and decisions. I am responsible for my behavior. I take complete accountability of every failure...every setback...and I accept that it is me and only me who can change my current state"*. I think that's the freedom we must aspire for...freedom of ownership. Until we reach that state... *we will remain prisoners...prisoners of our past...prisoners of our circumstances*. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and take good care of yourself.

There is a lot of confusion around whether to add your friends to FB and then here or the other way around. 

In the past 2 weeks, a lot of pushstarters have reached out to me asking *how to add people in their network to this community?*

It’s pretty simple, just share this form with the interested folks in your network, we will add them here directly after going through their profile once 😋😋

Sounds good? 

Then start sharing this registration form with fellow founders in your network:

       Come Witness a Mega Event of “Leaders Speak 1.0” to register click on this link - https://www.townscript.com/e/leaders-speak-10-323334
[26/01/19, 12:10:33 PM] Rajneesh BAF (ps): *A Crow and Garuda* 🙏 *- "Just Drop"..*

Once a Crow, holding on to a prey (piece of food), was flying to a place to sit & eat. 

However, a flock of Eagles were chasing it. The crow was anxious and was flying higher and higher, yet eagles were after the poor crow. 

Just then "Garuda" saw the pain in the eyes of the crow. Coming closer to the crow, he asked:

"What's wrong? You seem to be very "disturbed" and in  "stress"?"..

The crow cried "Look at these eagles!! They are after me to kill me".

Garuda being the bird of wisdom spoke "Oh my friend!! They are not after you to kill you!! They are after that piece of meat that you are holding in your beak". Just drop it and see what will happen.

The crow followed the instructions of Garuda and dropped the piece of meat, and there you go, all the eagles flew towards the falling meat.

Garuda smiled and said "The Pain is only till you hold on to it" Just Drop" it.

The crow just bowed and said "I dropped this piece of meat, now, I can fly even higher.."

There is a message for us from this story too:

1. People carry  the huge burden called "Ego," which creates a false identity about us, that we create for ourselves saying "I need love, I need to be invited, I am so and so.. "etc..." Just Drop ....

2. People get irritated fast by "others actions" it can be my friend, My parent, My children, My colleague, My life partner... and I get the fumes of "anger "..."Just Drop....

3. People compare themselves with others.. in beauty, wealth, life style, marks, talent and appraisals and feel disturbed... We must be grateful with what we have ... comparisons, negative emotions .." Just Drop...

🇮🇳Happy Republic Day🇮🇳

[28/01/19, 8:38:28 AM] Sanjeev H: When you know your Purpose...when you know your *WHY*...you can always figure out your HOW. That’s the importance of *Goal Setting in life – professional or personal*. Your goals must be powerful enough to compel you...powerful enough to ignite that fire in you. Unless you reach that stage of your life...you are not living...you are merely existing. I know numerous SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ... *people who were fragile, who were weak to do anything meaningful in their life*...who were too scared (or noncommittal) to have any goals or purpose in life. Later, through their family and friends, the universe tricked them to start something...they were told that they have an option to return if they FAIL. They entered the game...and they got trapped. They were abused...humiliated...criticized...called names. *Stakes increased...and they reached a point of no return*. They were left with no option...but to fight. They realized that GIVING-UP IS NOT AN OPTION. They learned, *“if death is the ultimate end...I will fight and die, instead of dying the death of regrets”*. Sometimes, I have learned, life put us through harsh ways... *so that we live a meaningful life...so that we find the purpose of our lives...so that we find our WHY*.
If you haven't yet found...find your WHY. Have a wonderful week ahead and very good care of yourself.

Hey, this is Mayank, am a Partner at Affingo Tech (www.affingotech.com), and head Marketing among other functions for its products. We are currently focusing on two:

(i) *SaralStocks* "Higher Returns, Faster!"
(www.saralstocks.com | Fb: /saralstocks | Twitter: @saralstocks)
Next *Eicher Motors* or *Avanti Feeds*? Most retail equity investors get sub-par returns because they can’t identify growth stocks efficiently & are not disciplined to use rule-based investment approach. SaralStocks solves this problem. Facilitates algo-based discovery of growth stocks, and portfolio management. 

_If you had like to be a SaralStocks user (we do free Zoom demo's), or invest in our business or foresee any synergies with yours; please ping me._ 
(footnote: 3 stalwart brokers/investment behemoths of Pune are on board)

(ii) *Khojpal* "Connect Locally!" {Available on Google Play & App Store}
(www.khojpal.com | Fb: /khojpal)
We offer our users a private ride sharing platform that reduces their fuel costs + brings down carbon footprint + unclogs city roads. And, we offer marketplaces for artisans, chefs and other "home" entrepreneurs to showcase & sell their produce. Want to advertise your newly opened brick & mortar store? Hop on. 

Emergency situation? Ambulance needed urgently? Find one on Khojpal, and book*. With Uber/Ola kind of tracking.
(*this facility currently available in Pune city)

That's not it! Want to find yourself a tennis mate, or nearby guitar classes? We'll help you with that too.

_With Google's Neighborly, we stand no chance? I'd beg to differ. Again, user/investor/synergy? Ping me._

In past avatars, i was briefly the co-Founder of an epharmacy. Other history: https://bit.ly/2CT76zF

[29/01/19, 12:13:42 PM] Kedar Gadgil: This is Jim Thorpe. Look closely at the photo, you can see that he's wearing different socks and shoes. This wasn't a fashion statement. It was the 1912 Olympics, and Jim, an American Indian from Oklahoma represented the U.S. in track and field. On the morning of his competitions, his shoes were stolen. Luckily, Jim ended up finding one shoe in a garbage can and someone gave him another. That's the pair that he's wearing in the photo. But one of the shoes was too big, so he had to wear an extra sock. Wearing these shoes, Jim won two gold medals that day.

This is a perfect reminder that you don't have to resign to the excuses that have held you back. So what if life hasn't been fair? What are you going to do about it today? Whatever you woke up with this morning; stolen shoes, ill health, bad day at work, don't let it stop you from running your race. You can experience more in life if you'll get over the excuses and get on with living. You can have reasons or you can have results and you can't have both. (h/t: Linkedin)

(confused which tag is more apt, but anyway...)

On Sunday, a lot of us spoke of foraying into/wanting to tap the US market. Europe, anyone? 

In that context, might be good to be aware of Estonia's e-Residency (https://e-resident.gov.ee) and Lithuania's Startup Visa (https://startupvisalithuania.com). They serve as efficient gateways to EU.

[29/01/19, 11:53:11 PM] Mayur (ps): This message could not have come at better timing 🙂

One of my friends works as technical recruiter/HR in a reputed MNC

One big education sector company here in Pune has hired him privately for their technical staff hiring

Their requirements are similar to yours.

So I've convinced him to get me a meeting with that company and I'll try to convince them to outsource their work to me instead of hiring in-house team.

So I've prepared a few points which I get to pitch you. Worst case, they don't convince you, and I get to prepare better for them. Best case, I convince two parties instead of one
🙂

1. *Are you hiring crane for removing a splinter?*

Inhouse team works great, given an experienced person drives it and it takes a lot to put this type of team together.

Great people will work inhouse for you only if they see future in your place and future can be guaranteed to them if you see considerable amount of work ahead for such a team in your venture.

If you are sure you will have constant work for them and it is beneficial for your business, do go ahead with in-house team.

But if you're not sure, or your scenario is building stuff once and maintaining it later or little upgrades over time, outsourcing is best.

2. *Chemistry is underrated*
It takes time to build chemistry between a tech team, especially when there are designers and developers both are involved!
If you hire an in-house team to work on a project, at least make sure they've worked together before at some capacity.

Chemistry is often underrated and it's one of the hidden factors shrinking your costs or sending it through the roof.

Dedicated agencies clearly have an edge here and it's best for all if you pay them for utilising that chemistry for your project.

3. *Cost*
A firm which has been doing this work professionally for a while now can keep their costs way lower than an in-house team.

So many factors at play here. Availability of work makes sure they have great resources available, everything works smooth as a machine, and additional operational costs such as setting up processes etc are well optimised.

Resources are generally used to peak efficiency in such environment as opposed to environment which is being newly set-up, driving overall costs lower for you.

As far as your factors are concerned: *inhouse team* gives you more *control*.
While an *agency* gives you better *flexibility*.

When it comes to disclosure and privacy, an agency beats employees hands down.
Both can be subjected to NDA's and non competes etc but repercussions of breaking them for agencies are much devastating, while keeping them is much more rewarding as compared to inhouse employees.

*Conclusion* is: hire in-house if your venture is tech centric and there will be constant work available to them. In long run, this is beneficial.

Hire an agency in every other scenario or if you're unsure.

Or what I mostly suggest is, hire an agency for initial deliverables. Then hire small team in-house for maintenance and small upgrades.
Keep hiring agency for serious upgrades.

Even for books, I got a few of them cheaper than Amazon.
I just keep myself open to both
Jispe saasta mile le leta hu
[01/02/19, 9:21:53 AM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): Great observation. 👍 And also good point. People should be loyal to the price and not to the brand. Amazon or Flipkart, or something else... Doesn't matter. As long as job is done, brand is secondary. However, many times we end up getting brand  emotional.
[01/02/19, 9:38:22 AM] ‪+91 91588 58989‬: But Amazon's return policy is *way* better than Flipkart's. Transactions are reversed without any questions asked. Makes a huge difference.
[01/02/19, 9:39:59 AM] Amit Rawat: Difference between Indian & American company SOP & implementation 😃
[01/02/19, 9:41:18 AM] ‪+91 91588 58989‬: 🙂
[01/02/19, 10:26:05 AM] Sunil (ps): Then why go for a Macbook and not a cheap windows laptop?
[01/02/19, 10:27:17 AM] Sunil (ps): I have to disagree with what you say.

Price obviously is one point I'll think of while deciding where to buy from, but I'll also consider a lot of other factors. For example the one which @919158858989 mentioned. 🙂

[01/02/19, 11:05:55 AM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): True. These days good windows laptops are better than MacBook. I hate my Mac pro even though it is customized. In recent few years, only good product from Apple is EarPods.
[01/02/19, 11:08:36 AM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: Brilliant, Parth. Others are discussing where to buy retail stuff from, let me be the first to congratulate.

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

[02/02/19, 11:57:49 AM] Nidhi (pune): Looking out for most economical co-working space in Kalyani Nagar/Viman Nagar/Yerwada area. Any clues?
[02/02/19, 12:02:57 PM] Tushar Lutuke (ps): Good question. Ideally not required. But Razorapay is one of the few PGs who do a 100% online KYC ... at least they are the ones who started with automation of most of the documentation process.

And over the years they have improved over their own benchmark! 

I guess promotor PAN could be a erstwhile legacy process that is still active OR it might be a RBI mandate.
[02/02/19, 12:04:30 PM] Kedar Gadgil: I intend to write to them. So, if it is a legacy that needs doing away with, perhaps they'll take cognisance and the next company to register won't be harassed
[02/02/19, 12:05:04 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Anyone know the email id of their promoter. It is only fitting thatI write to the promoter 😜
[02/02/19, 12:09:51 PM] Tushar Lutuke (ps): Put it on @Razorpay twitter and Harshil Mathur ... They will definitely let you know

[02/02/19, 12:14:33 PM] Kedar Gadgil: Wow...Now they need authorised signatory 's address proof. The Board Resolution isn't enough!
[02/02/19, 12:16:30 PM] Kedar Gadgil: This is a very Indian thing, I have noticed. Ask for every document you can, whether or not relevant. Ask for copies. Ask for attestations. Ask for originals. Ask for physical copies. Then ask for scanned ones. Just keep piling documents. And then, still not have any data because all of it gets lost, misplaced, hacked, or mishandled! Sigh

[04/02/19, 8:52:47 AM] Sanjeev H: If U R truly passionate about *turning UR dreams into a reality*, U can do it. Let no one convince U otherwise. Here are 3 things U must do to stay motivated when no one can see UR vision - 
*Know Your Mission* - Clarity equals power. To stay motivated in pursuit of UR big goal or dream, U have to get clear about what U R trying to accomplish and why U R trying to accomplish it. Why U R doing it, is more important than what U R doing. As motivational speaker, Eric Thomas said, *"If UR why don't make you cry then that's not UR WHY"*.
*Meet New People Regularly* - If the people that U spend the most if UR time with don't believe in U or UR vision then they are the one who is dragging U down. If U want it bad enough U must be strong enough to break the chains and surround yourself with those that support UR vision. Remember words of Ray Robinson, *"To be a champion, you must believe in yourself when no one else does"*. 
*Celebrate the Small Wins* - Small wins are crucial when U R trying to do something massive. *Small wins over the time lead to massive accomplishments*. It's a great habit to build momentum and confidence within U. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and take very good care of yourself.

[04/02/19, 1:48:39 PM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: Have you guys heard of #LinkedInLocal ? Might be an interesting networking opportunity. Here's a brief description from the LinkedIn page of Priya Dhawan - Pune host. No, I dont work for/with her, found about the concept from the posts of a neighbor. The next monthly meetup is on 9th.

========================================================================
On 2nd June 2017, Anna McAfee held her first LinkedInLocal Meet in Coffs Harbour, Australia, where 18 LinkedIn members in the vicinity, met each other face to face for the first time. In a couple of months, this simple concept went viral & reached India.

On 10th March 2018, I held the first LinkedInLocal Meet in Aundh, Pune, where 50 LinkedIn members met each other face to face for the first time. 7 editions have been held in Pune since then.

On 24th July 2018, the big news on the night of the launch of LocalX was that #linkedinlocal events had reached 60 countries, 360 towns and cities and almost 600 city hosts in the span of a year. It was the first big team event held in London, with 3 co-founders, Anna McAfee, Alexandra Galviz, Ryan Troll joining other Linkedin Members in person, Manu Goswami on a live link from Canada, and the staggering thousands tuned into a live stream. 

A new brand LocalX : the social impact organisation was set up to steer #linkedinlocal events

Here's what to expect at a #LinkedInLocalPune Meet usually :

Date : 1st or 2nd Saturday of the month
Time : 4pm sharp to 8pm sharp
Venue : Keeps moving suburb to suburb within Pune
Dresscode : Be yourself

Event flow
4pm to 5pm : High Tea, HighFives, Headshots & Interactions
5pm to 5.45pm : Energisers & Icebreakers
5.45pm to 6.30pm : Topic and Speaker as per theme of the event
6.30pm to 7.15pm : Topic and Speaker as per theme of the event
7.15pm to 7.45pm : Members are welcome to #shareyourstory
7.45pm to 8pm : Winding up with #Groupfies

This is an event facilitated by LinkedIn members across the globe, to meet other LinkedIn members in person. This is not the typical/ formal seminar or conference format. LinkedIn members are encouraged to know each other better in a casual-social ambience. Any LinkedIn member can register & join in to meet a diverse group of 50/100+ like-minded professionals.

My company Intuhire (www.intuhire.com) is working on  a campaign over the next 2 months to find the best developers in Pune/Mumbai area . Our technology helps test candidates for different skills as a combination of aptitude, programming skill and ability to work in various frameworks. The final goal is to connect companies with hidden stars who don't get enough exposure otherwise.

At this moment, I am looking for corporate partners who would like to hire from our program . The more companies register, the easier it is for us to encourage developers and universities to come on board. We will provide free access to our best developers to any companies that pre register with us.  Do register below if you are looking for interns or full time developers

Rings a bell?? 🤔🤔

Yeah, you're right- It's *#PushQnA.* 😎😎

We're back with an *all new* version of *PushQnA*, starting *next week*.🔥🔥

So what's new?

PushQnA is not just gonna be a QnA session, but in addition to that the host would be sharing *original content* freshly brewed for Pushstarters! 

The content would be shared *3 days prior* to the QnA session and would be *101 themed* pertaining to the topic.

This content is specially for those who are curious about the topic and want to gain some basic knowledge much before the QnA. 

We're excited to begin with the new revamped PushQnA, which would happen *every Tuesday at 9:30 pm* 🤩🤩

Stay Tuned for further updates!!

[05/02/19, 3:09:52 PM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: Brief about *SaralStocks* www.saralstocks.com

Most stock investors get sub-par returns in the markets because:
^they can’t identify growth stocks without investing significant amount of time for searching; 
^they keep losing money as they don’t use rule-based investment approach and when their stocks start losing value they  don’t sell when they should sell;
^the software tools available to help investors are hard-to-use, operate in silos and flood the user with data that only experts can understand. 

The software products available to help investors are hard-to-use, operate in silos and flood the user with data that only experts can understand. This  makes it hard to make investment decisions.  

SaralStocks solves these problems by automating end-to-end stock lifecycle processes. Discovery of growth stocks becomes simpler and quicker; and Portfolio can be managed through algorithmic (“algo”) decision making that even a new investor can use. 

If the above interests you, we can give you a *free demo* on how to maximize your profits & cut your losses. Just ask me: 91.9890071829 (Mayank)

[07/02/19, 11:01:31 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Let me know if you get any
[07/02/19, 11:02:00 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): BD + Interns is sort of an oxymoron
[07/02/19, 11:02:11 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): BD ppl need experience to become good
[07/02/19, 11:02:18 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Interns generally don't have experience
[07/02/19, 11:02:52 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Even if you say sales is an art and can't be taught, you still need time to perfect it.
[07/02/19, 11:03:06 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Hired someone last year for 3 months. 0 result. Learnt it the hard way.
[07/02/19, 11:03:16 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Instead find a freelancer
[07/02/19, 11:03:26 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Who can work on fixed + commission basis
[07/02/19, 11:03:57 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): At least you learnt it bro. There are people who don't 😁
[07/02/19, 11:04:15 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): 🙈
[07/02/19, 11:04:50 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s the fixed part generally?
[07/02/19, 11:05:14 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): If you are still adamant in hiring then make sure they are with you for 6 months minimum. 2 months training plus 4 months on job.
[07/02/19, 11:05:38 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): I used to pay 15-25k fixed. This covers their food, travel and other stuff.
[07/02/19, 11:05:56 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): I was very competitive with the commission part
[07/02/19, 11:06:06 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): So they were fine with less fixed pay
[07/02/19, 11:06:39 AM] Satyam (pushstart): Where to find? I am ready for it but finding right people in education domain is a big challenge..
[07/02/19, 11:06:42 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): If they could convert 2 leads, they could survive 6 months like a king.
[07/02/19, 11:06:51 AM] Ahaan Pandit (pushstart): Found mine on angel list
[07/02/19, 11:06:58 AM] Satyam (pushstart): Ok

[07/02/19, 10:39:16 PM] Krishnaa Kantthawala- Smart Foods: Don't wish to argue but I'd be more happy to see small local retailers benefitting from something rather than giants like Amazon n Wal-Mart
[07/02/19, 10:43:20 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): It's a perceptive. Even if you see the entry of giants are creating employment opportunities. 

Don't you think it is more of a cause and effect scenario which is unavoidable?
[07/02/19, 10:43:48 PM] Aditya (agiliolabs): Cloudtail has already made changes to it's cap table.. they r 76% Indian now .. so should be back to business on Amazon soon.

We prefer if some foreign company earns profit but we won't like if some Indian company tries to become big. Then we are the same people who will compare our startups / companies with china where pretty much all foreign companies blocked from doing business.

[08/02/19, 2:55:07 PM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: Fancy places to go to & fancier gifts are the talk of the town as Valentine's approaches.

Here's a little spin on it from SaralStocks: on 14 Feb 2003 had you invested ₹2,000 on Eicher Motors stock; next week on 14 Feb 2019 you could gift your Valentine a Harley Davidson, or fly with him to a super-fancy Mauritius vacation with that same money compounded many a time.

Think power of growth stocks! Think SaralStocks (www.saralstocks.com)
[08/02/19, 3:07:06 PM] Tushar Lutuke (ps): Same goes for a Maruti or MRF or  a HDFC Bank. 
That's what the brokering/MFs/PMS industry has been doing. 
Statistical convenience in hindsight.
Public understands compounding, the fear is of a positive compounding like Eicher or a negative compounding aka erosion like a Suzlon.

In short you need to address the problem with a proof of concept in hindsight, not just the usual compounding story.
[08/02/19, 3:08:35 PM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: We are backtesting our models with markets data for the last 20 years. That should be published soon on our website.

[08/02/19, 3:12:13 PM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: haha, yes and no.
[08/02/19, 3:14:04 PM] ‪+91 83799 70500‬: For the no part then, how much backtesting is useful/reliable. I am not questioning your model, but I want to learn/understand better
[08/02/19, 3:42:47 PM] Pankaj Wahane (pspune): Are the models based on purely stock prices or take into account the external events like news, social sentiments or for that matter fundamental analysis and what’s going to be prediction horizon.. are you looking at short term quick wins or long term investment opportunities.. 


The Your website looks promising but want to understand what differentiates it from likes of screener.in from stock screening perspective?

The population rise & the higher degree of competition may have given rise to such bluffers, wherein students are treated as their customers & the organizations would cross any limits to make them happy.

But quality education is still something that is sought after. Not everyone has decreased the level of standards as a compromise for better business. ☺

[18/02/19, 9:38:14 AM] Sanjeev H: In an introspection after Pulwama Terrorist attack, I realized that our life has become so unpredictable...so uncertain. On top of that, we are sitting on a time bomb – *STRESS*. There is workplace stress, relationship stress, the stress of the unknown, etc. There are so many things we want to say...we want to express but we do not. When we step out of our house...we don’t know if we will return back or not, and the things we want to say, remain unsaid. If we are not already doing it, I think we should start doing the following –

1) *Express Your Love* to your loved ones as often as possible. Tell them that you care for them. Tell them that they are an important part of your life. 

2) *Seek Apology*, even if you think you have not made any mistake. Intentionally, we don’t want to hurt our loved ones but sometimes, unknowingly we say things or we do things we don’t mean it but those things are sharp and blunt enough to hurt them. Be apologetic. 

3) *Express Your Gratitude*...say, Thank you, not ONLY to the Universe but also to the people around you...your loved ones. Acknowledge and appreciate their contribution to your life.

4) Lastly, *Let Go*. Do not hold any resentment. Forgive people...even if they have not sought your apology. It is important for you to be at peace.

*One day, it will be our last day, which is the hard truth of life and we will not be left with enough time to tell our loved ones how much they mean to us...how much grateful we are to them. Say it today...and mean it*. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and take very good care of yourself.

[26/02/19, 12:07:23 PM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): Guys, IAF carried out major surgical strikes. I consider this as good management lesson. Gauge, find weakness and engage. Also great way to go towards becoming major  power in the world (obviously next step is blue water navy etc). No matter which political party takes the power this year, I hope India will ascertain definitive & leadership role in the world. Much needed. Will be extremely helpful in the long term.
[26/02/19, 12:13:33 PM] Sayan Ganguly: 1. Great to hear.
2. While Pushstart remains dedicated to National Growth and wellbeing, what's the relevance of this discussion if it cannot materialize into Entrepreneurship in Defence Sector? Let's adhere to deep and silent patriotism than loud nationalism. Great read but please steer the following conversation in this direction.
3. More number of strikes have happened than how many have been covered by the Media.
[26/02/19, 12:15:32 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Second this. Opinions like this as per Pushstart guidelines should happen on Facebook group.
[26/02/19, 12:23:22 PM] Sayan Ganguly: More people can be inspired on FB Group
[26/02/19, 12:24:10 PM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): 👍 TBH my view point was bit different & apolitical and was about leadership but I like the way you added point # 3 - that sounds bit political to me 😉
[26/02/19, 12:24:24 PM] Nikhil Jathar (ps): Nonetheless agree. Not going into debate 😊
[26/02/19, 12:24:48 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Great
[26/02/19, 12:48:30 PM] Amit Rawat: Guys let's keep direct & indirect political comments out else we all have something to say and then it's will become like any other group

[26/02/19, 12:54:59 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Different channels are meant for different types of conversations and there are ways to evolve a particular conversation to the relevance of a particular channel
[26/02/19, 12:55:33 PM] Tarun (ps): Chalo, let's change the subject now. 😊

However if your last year revenue was less than 20 lakhs then get is not applicable for you, and there should be a way for you to configure that for your event.
[02/03/19, 12:17:12 AM] Neeraj Joshi: It’s like a mandatory kind of shit
[02/03/19, 12:17:31 AM] Amit Sharma (pushstart): That doesn't make sense, check with their support.
[02/03/19, 12:18:26 AM] Lovinta (ps): It's mandatory to put an hsn on townscript. It's not for our taxation but theirs. So they can charge that percent to the buyers
[02/03/19, 12:20:16 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Thanks
[02/03/19, 12:20:26 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @918087770667 provided me with the code
[02/03/19, 12:20:30 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Let me try that out
[02/03/19, 12:20:33 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 🙌🏻🙌🏻
[02/03/19, 12:20:40 AM] Neeraj Joshi: All of you guys are amazing
[02/03/19, 12:20:43 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 🔥🔥
[02/03/19, 12:21:15 AM] Amit Sharma (pushstart): GST’s Impact on selling event tickets online
Compulsory GST registration of Event Organisers selling tickets online:
1) As per the new rule, anyone who’s “selling tickets (or any other product) online” will have to be registered for GST. Yes! Even if your sales are less than INR 20 lacs annually, you still need to be registered for GST.
[02/03/19, 12:21:38 AM] Amit Sharma (pushstart): That's from townscript blog, didn't know this!!
[02/03/19, 12:22:01 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 😭😭
[02/03/19, 12:22:09 AM] Neeraj Joshi: This is real shit
[02/03/19, 12:22:40 AM] ‪+91 98900 71829‬: So, even for one-off events, say an annual alumni party?
[02/03/19, 12:22:52 AM] Neeraj Joshi: That’s what
[02/03/19, 12:23:09 AM] Amit Sharma (pushstart): That's how I am reading it, it doesn't make sense though.
[02/03/19, 12:23:46 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Lets talk with the townscript Founder directly :p
[02/03/19, 12:23:57 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @919860407383 :)
[02/03/19, 12:24:08 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Kindly send him this query if possible
[02/03/19, 12:28:18 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I just used the code sent my @918087770667 and it worked
[02/03/19, 12:28:19 AM] Neeraj Joshi: For me
[02/03/19, 12:28:43 AM] Neeraj Joshi: The code I used is used for Events, Exhibitions, Conventions And Trade Shows Organisation And Assistance Services 😊
[02/03/19, 12:29:05 AM] Amit Sharma (pushstart): 👍

[04/03/19, 8:37:11 AM] Sanjeev H: The world is filled with *people who want to be successful* and there are a million articles telling what U should start doing to achieve success. While some of these are great, often times it’s *what U need to STOP doing...U need to give up, that’s more important*. Here is my list of FIVE things U must STOP DOING to be successful in life. 

1) *Stop Making Excuses* – Take 100% accountability for UR life. Every single aspect of it. U have to give up excuses if U want to find success. Successful people have taken the matter in their own hands and know that they are the only ones *who are responsible for their life choices – both successes and failures*.

2) *Stop The Victim Mentality* – Everyone has a story of a struggle to share – some people define themselves by it, others act in spite of it. UR past will only be UR future if you carry it there. *UR back-story will not define UR life*. The only thing that defines UR life is what U choose to do in response to UR struggling past. 

3) *Stop Fantasying the need to be Liked By Everyone* – Nobody is universally liked, largely for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with them. *U R going to be liked by some, loved by others, criticized by a handful, and disliked by a few regardless of what U choose to do with UR life*. Therefore, it makes the most sense to do what you want regardless of how other people will respond. 

4) *Stop Chasing Perfection* - Perfection is the lowest standard, because perfect doesn’t exist, in any area of life. *Nothing will ever be perfect regardless of how much we want it to be*. Therefore, do not strive towards perfection and do not let UR fear of not being good enough get the best of U.

5) *Stop Playing Small* - U need to give up playing small and start thinking big. *Dream big, have big goals, and ambition that seems like insanity to most people*. Sure, people will doubt and belittle UR dreams, but who cares. If U don’t take risks on yourself, UR dreams will die with U. They’ll never go from thought to reality. 

Have a wonderful week ahead and very good care of yourself.

[05/03/19, 4:24:03 PM] Atijya (Pushstart): Beautiful people of Pune. We're organizing our second edition of Safe Space Initiative : Chapter 2 in Pune, Viman Nagar. 😍🙋🙋

A one of a kind event to gather people under one roof and share what they're going through, have gone through, who they really are, with strangers. 

To have an intimate and real conversation around our mental health without any judgment. 

Date 📅 : 17th March, 2019 (Sunday) 

Time 🕧 : 12 : 30 - 4 : 30 PM. 

Venue ☕🍵 : Tales Over Tales Cafe, Viman Nagar. 

*WHAT'S THE EVENT ABOUT?*

👣 Safe space where people gather together and share what they're going through in an intimate, vulnerable setting. 

👣 Blindfolded, everyone will get a chance to be themselves and not be judged for it. 

👣 7-10 minutes to speak their hearts out. 

👣 No advice. No feedback. No judgment. 

*WHO SHOULD ATTEND THE EVENT?*

 👍 Those who're tired of the endless pretense.

👍 Students, working professionals, the young, the old.

👍 Those who would love to share what they're really going through, have gone through.

👍 Those who have people around them but no real friends to share what they're going through. 

👍 Those who're just tired of the endless stigma and judgment. 

👍 Those who want to just observe and revel in vulnerable and heartfelt conversations. 

We'll be ending with a reflection session in the end, wonderful coffee/tea on the house from our lovely hosts, and a warm and mighty hug before we part ways. 💕

The event is open to 30 people.

Registration --

Early Bird (On Spot / Online for first 15 people) -- 300 rupees.

Later -- 400 rupees. 

Fill in the google form below and we'll get in touch with you --

Let's together, celebrate what makes us real, different, special, and human. 

Enough of the stigma, ridicule, and pretense. 

Let's be real, together. ✊💪

If you've ever been there, here's something for you.

We're organizing our second edition of Safe Space Initiative : Chapter 2 in Pune, Viman Nagar. 😍🙋🙋

Time 🕧 : 12 : 30 - 4 : 30 PM. 

Venue ☕🍵 : Tales Over Tales Cafe, Viman Nagar. 

*WHAT'S THE EVENT ABOUT?*

👣 Safe space where people gather together and share what they're going through in an intimate, vulnerable setting.

👣 No advice. No feedback. No judgment. 

*WHO SHOULD ATTEND THE EVENT?*

👍 Those who have people around them but no real friends to share what they're going through. 

👍 Those who're just tired of the endless stigma and judgment. 

👍 Those who want to just observe and revel in vulnerable and heartfelt conversations. 

We'll be ending with a reflection session in the end, wonderful coffee/tea on the house from our lovely hosts, and a warm and mighty hug before we part ways. 💕

[08/03/19, 11:56:43 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Hey everyone, first of all a very happy women's day! I run Wicked Broz, a graffiti company. I want to announce something big I'm doing with Wicked Broz by the end of this month. Hope some of you feel it's a just cause and come forward to help us out.
[08/03/19, 11:56:44 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): In January of this year, we undertook a week long trip across Rajasthan upto Agra with a couple of friends from around the world. There was Rikis Santander, a street artist from Chile and Abigail Aroha Jensen, a contemporary artist from New Zealand. We all went mad clicking epic pictures of each other in every pose one can think of at the forts, in the palaces and all over the streets. And the compelling stories of those places made it all the more epic. However, something hit us a few days after this magical trip was over. 
Rikis said two things about the gullies of India - one, they are so crowded (no surprise) and two, there are very few women in this crowd. 

Now that’s not something we didn’t know before. We’ve seen it all our lives. And we even know why it is so!
But maybe that’s why this statement coming from a foreigner missiled into our brain. 
Why? Why is our country so fucked up? 

So we took Rikis’ observation back to Marol, the home of the Wicked Broz, where we’d been planning a hip hop festival for months. Now, we had a new meaning to it. 

Ladies First is a women-led street art festival. The first of its kind in India. Our endeavour is to promote women street artists and in turn bring more women to the streets in India. Back to the basics, dude! Represent. Hip-hop. 

For the first version of our festival that’s going to be held from 25 Mar to 31 Mar, 7 brilliant female artists have come together - 

Anpu, a well known name in the Indian Street Art scene who’s signature cat stencil is always a delight to spot. 
Sam Sam, a part of the first wave of graffiti artists in India who’s been at it for almost a decade now. 
Avantika Mathur, who’s bringing all the boho vibes with her wherever she goes and using surrealism to convey her truth. 
Shirin Shaikh, a solo traveler who’s heart and art are both closest to nature. 
Kesar Khinvasara, the goddess of mandalas whose inspiration comes from the most basic element of drawing - a line. 
Ratna Singh, whose style is all about bringing Warli art to the walls of the world. 
And Abigail Aroha Jensen (yes, the same one we mentioned before), whose fresh, modern style has been a part of the first transgender art fest in Prayagraj. 

All of us together hope to bring more power to the women on the streets, way beyond the walls of Marol and Mumbai. 

What else we hope to do is to bring together leading figures in Indian Street art to come and speak about women, art and their experiences. If you want to simply pick up a brush and get moving, we have through street art workshops for you too! 
And if you want to just come check out the scene and learn a little about where it all comes from, we’ve got screenings and graffiti tours for you to show how art has been taking over the streets for the last few years. 

Wicked Broz has sprung from hip-hop. We can never forget that. So in spirit of that, we’ll also be hosting a cypher on the last day of the festival calling out all b-girls and female rappers! 

Through Ladies First we hope to change the gender representation and inclusion in the scene a little bit, to push the needle against what is considered taboo. You see, nothing is a waste of time ladies and gentleman! 
Shaitani bina bachpan choro, zindagi bekar hai dude. 

If you want to join our movement as a volunteer/ collaborator/ partner/ sponsor, reach out to us at 8887795823 or email us ladiesfirststreetart@gmail.com/zain@wickedbroz.com. 

See you at the streets!

[08/03/19, 1:31:44 PM] ‪+91 73761 91262‬: Hi guys,
I want to shoot testimonial videos of my clients. I tried it with a professional last time - it was pretty expensive (1+ lakh for 2 videos) plus a really bad experience due to my lack of expertise in the category.

I am looking for cheaper ways of doing it. One option is doing it through an iPhone. Has anyone every tried it? Is the video quality good enough?
And are there any stands for phones?

It's a slightly lame question but I am a complete layman. Please share any suggestions that you can. TIA.
[08/03/19, 1:33:11 PM] ‪+91 90110 67273‬: iphone is decent enough and looks natural . its quality is quite good

[08/03/19, 1:35:47 PM] ‪+91 73761 91262‬: But the video comes in portrait format
[08/03/19, 1:35:56 PM] Bharat Jethani (ps): A good quality high end phone like Samsung or iPhone works better... You need to buy a separate Mic for better audio quality
[08/03/19, 1:36:02 PM] ‪+91 73761 91262‬: Ah! Tell me about it.
And the quality was so bad.
[08/03/19, 1:36:33 PM] Bharat Jethani (ps): I have resources who can do it cheaper... Else but a high end phone 📱, mic and a stand
[08/03/19, 1:36:38 PM] ‪+91 73761 91262‬: Can you please suggest which one? It will be a new battle to find the right mic
[08/03/19, 1:37:14 PM] Bharat Jethani (ps): Give me few minutes.. I will chk with my friend

[09/03/19, 7:36:45 PM] Arunaday Basu (ps): It's a difficult job if you have too many images... DM if you are confused regarding this... Best is to use a plugin called Duplicator if you are trying to take a backup and restore it.. But if you want to transfer just images (and a lot of them) you will probably need to write a custom script which will not only download the images to your new WordPress installation but also register it in the Media Library.. Cause in WordPress, it's not enough to just drop the images into the server folder... You need to register each image (which happens automatically when you upload an image in the media library)...

[11/03/19, 7:58:49 AM] Sanjeev H: *Critics, doubters, haters and naysayers...they will all discourage U because they R threatened by UR success*. They believe that if U become successful they will be less significant. If U become successful...they will be left behind. If you become more...they will be become less. It's a small mind mentality - *INSECURITY*. Are U going to let insecure individuals bring U down to their level? 
*Just refuse to listen to voices that will never understand UR dream...shut them off*. Be deaf to the opinions of those who never and will probably never achieve anything meaningful in their own life. U R capable of making UR own choices. And U R strong enough to handle the consequences if it doesn't work out. 
There is only one voice U must listen to - the voice of UR heart. *Never allow people who gave up on their dreams convince U to give up on yours*. 
Have a wonderful week ahead and very good care of yourself.
