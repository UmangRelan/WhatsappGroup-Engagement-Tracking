Hi everyone! I have a friend who is in the process of developing a program / application that will allow you to keep better track of your friends around the world, reconnect with ease and make the most of your network to ensure that your next trip is the best it can be through a variety of planning functions. Here is a post from him: 

"I have made a very short survey (2-3 minutes) that hopes identify the problems people have when travelling and reconnecting with friends down the track.

I'd really appreciate it if you could take the time to quickly do the survey, it will be extremely helpful for my research and will hopefully allow me to give you all an application that will be extremely useful in the future!

Thanks in advance! <3"

PS- My Experience of this survey was very good.

[02/05/18, 6:04:21 PM] Sameer (pushstart): Although we already created the Costing and benefits
[02/05/18, 6:04:29 PM] Sameer (pushstart): Sheet
[02/05/18, 11:22:33 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So I have been asked and told multiple times to allow discussions on the WhatsApp group and I don’t really encourage that. 

The reason is: 

I want maximum pushstaters to become part of the discussion and get benefitted:  
 
3 type of people become part of the discussion: 
1. The one who starts it: 1%  
2. The one who contributes: 4% 
3. The one who reads and learn: 95% 

If things are discussed on WhatsApp group: 
Total strength: 250 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 250 

On FB group: 
Strength: 8k 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 8k 

See the difference? 

The information shared in the discussion is priceless and a larger impact will be created if we can funnel all of it to the FB group. 

That's why: 
1. Share Idea
2. Launch Startup 
3. Ask Questions 
4. Share Content 

ON FB GROUP 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/Pushstarter

So let's impact the lives of thousands of entrepreneurs by doing all the discussions on the FB group. 

Thanks

[05/05/18, 12:25:00 PM] Sankeerth (pushstart): Great i love knowing about travel startups,similar to trillophilia??
[05/05/18, 12:32:39 PM] Ashish(pushstart): Actually , We started as a mobile-focused platform to build amazon & facebook for activities. Kind of interest based social media marketplace for activities. But then people started using it as a dating APP , which was diluting the whole idea. Even got selected in Fbstart to get few tools to build the mobile app better , But then we have pivoted for short term and there's a website now which is the focus , Its all about places now. Not exactly as Thrillophilia , as its into adventure space primarily , We are into 8 categories with more focus in adventure as the demand is more in this category compratively. So you can presume its similar , but it isn't. Though they are doing pretty well revenue wise , But have a bad name in the market from few folks in the industry i have spoken to.
[05/05/18, 12:43:41 PM] Sankeerth (pushstart): Awesome,all the best😊
[05/05/18, 1:17:24 PM] Ashish(pushstart): Thanks a lot brother :)

[10/05/18, 1:48:45 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I feel few things (may be correct or totally wrong)-

Was this in plan for mid way after seeing big venture funds investing into it and the founders sensed this kind of opportunity coming and made up things in order to reach?

Is it not the beginning of dark day for crores of retailer and wholesellers in India?

Felt it like some Mughal Experor allowed entry of britishers for trading while thinking to make money from it but didn't see the big picture behind it coming.

I am stunned with how people are celebrating this as success.

Surely either I have lost totally what Entrepreneurship and startup means or these people forgot the real meaning of the keywords of change.

Thanks for responding.
Same thing us that Walmart will do whatever they want as in india no e-commerce policy exist.
They will kill all market in terms of *Distribution, kinara store , franchise.*
Walmart want to enter it the asian market as it is boycott in all other markets like china and Russia.
India is the easiest way to get that.
And flipkart will work as subsidy of Walmart as per the deal.
And after some time they will start investment in supermarket.
Then the real fight will start.
As per consumer point of view this deal gonna be *beneficial*
 but this will highly effect the *micro and *small* scale business in long run.
This gonna be unhealthy for *small startups*.
I must assure that this deal will *destroy flipkart or economy.*
What we are thinking that us amazon far behind the flipkart. 
No, not all flipkart have just *34%* of indian market and *amazon is at 27%.*

*77% accuried which is 75% in deal and rest 2% as stake(investment).*
Sachin bansal is out from the game(board member)
*Walmart's kriss aayar* will be next CEO as *kalyan Krishnamurti* also have to *quit as CEO.*
If we go to deep binny bansal will holding company from indian end.
 As such even *23%* is owned be *Tensent holdings, china*, *binny bansal*, *microsoft*, and *tiger global.*
So, binny bansal is only holding around 5% stake which is not at all *manipulative.*

[14/05/18, 3:06:34 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): So they are smart & well educated and should know that doing such things is unethical
[14/05/18, 3:06:41 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): they come asking for opportunities, mostly come with references and then once they get the offer letter, they disappeared, 4 of them infact, from roorkie and delhi
[14/05/18, 3:07:12 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): can anyone share the email of someone in IIT who i can report to
[14/05/18, 3:08:00 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Report it to training and placement office
[14/05/18, 3:08:11 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): email id hai ?
[14/05/18, 3:09:12 PM] Jeet (pushstart): But that will destroy his placements. 
I wouldn’t suggest you to do this😰😰
[14/05/18, 3:09:23 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Email id is available on websites
[14/05/18, 3:09:32 PM] Anjali (pushstart): +1
[14/05/18, 3:09:37 PM] Jeet (pushstart): And may destroy his career as well.
[14/05/18, 3:09:43 PM] Manika (pushstart): If s/he is joining via an institute then you should, but dont we always have such ppl around. This is the doen side of recruitment, so its better to have 2 backup / waitlisted candidates ready for such situations.
[14/05/18, 3:09:45 PM] Anjali (pushstart): College authorities hype these things a lot.
[14/05/18, 3:09:46 PM] Jeet (pushstart): So I would request not to do that.
[14/05/18, 3:10:41 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): backups are not the issue
[14/05/18, 3:10:59 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Just mail the student giving this dhamki
He won’t do after this.🙂🙂
[14/05/18, 3:11:43 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): If the candidate is insincere then getting them a bann is not a bad option.

Start with an email of formal threat and the do if he or she shows insincerity
[14/05/18, 3:11:47 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): see i dont want to destroy careers but then i spent over 10 hours on a couple of them, interviews, tasks, valuations, and made the letter and sent them, follow up and then no response, even if they read the email
[14/05/18, 3:12:43 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Yes I totally understand.

Would still request not formally Complain instead send a threat to Complain.
[14/05/18, 3:12:47 PM] Manika (pushstart): How can anyone give dhamki? Its an independent country, and ppl are free to choose the job. They must have got a better offer.
[14/05/18, 3:13:10 PM] Jeet (pushstart): This is the right thing. Better offer and it is right from candidate point of view.
[14/05/18, 3:13:21 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): then have the bloody courtesy to inform
[14/05/18, 3:13:25 PM] Jeet (pushstart): And it is even right from employer point of view.
[14/05/18, 3:13:33 PM] Anjali (pushstart): +1
[14/05/18, 3:13:34 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Agreed. One should inform.
[14/05/18, 3:13:52 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i have no issues if you say no, thats your right, but ignoring is not the way to go
[14/05/18, 3:14:07 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its disrespectful, even insulting
[14/05/18, 3:14:50 PM] Manika (pushstart): Yes. Happens all the time nowadays. I am into recruitment. And i can so feel your frustration. Even  if they join, they leave within 6 months.
[14/05/18, 3:14:54 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Putting out a social note in a formal way and explaining them the situation is important.

I am not sayiit should be dhamki but a notice that this might affect other students selection in future because if their irresponsibility and the same information will be conveyed to the college also.
[14/05/18, 3:15:32 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i have had people been hired full time and not turn up to work, i was so pissed off
[14/05/18, 3:16:06 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Hire more cautiously is the basic advice but that may not solve the problem.
[14/05/18, 3:16:16 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): every year i see atleast 25% to 30% people do this every year
[14/05/18, 3:16:17 PM] ‪+91 70423 36484‬: It happened with me too.. i guess for a better implementation we could mention these things prior selection
[14/05/18, 3:16:47 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its not iteration, thats natural, its the lack of professional attitude
[14/05/18, 3:16:48 PM] Manika (pushstart): Oh, that is a preety big figure.
[14/05/18, 3:17:50 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): people apply everywhere, say yes and then find a better opportunity and drop off the radar
[14/05/18, 3:18:02 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): very common with IIT, BITS and NIT students
[14/05/18, 3:18:22 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its the lack of response which is more upsetting rather than saying no
[14/05/18, 3:19:08 PM] Manika (pushstart): The truth is that kids nowadays are too smart. They would have 4-5 job offers. Even if they join, they get bored easily and leave.
[14/05/18, 3:20:11 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): thats not smartness, that's just bad attitude
[14/05/18, 3:21:09 PM] Manika (pushstart): Yes, courtesy is missing.
[14/05/18, 3:21:40 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Right. We need to mend ourselves to provide more intellectual stimulating kind of works
[14/05/18, 3:22:34 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its not that
[14/05/18, 3:22:52 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): sorry it doesnt warrant the attitude
[14/05/18, 3:23:42 PM] ‪+91 70423 36484‬: For now dont bother spending more time on the kid, and for the problem I think, we can simply let them know that we expect them to let us know about their status.
[14/05/18, 3:24:19 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i am on the fence about reporting to the college
[14/05/18, 3:24:31 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): and now on, no hiring from the A list colleged
[14/05/18, 3:24:34 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): *colleges
[14/05/18, 3:25:03 PM] Manika (pushstart): This is what even I have concluded and yielding better results.
[14/05/18, 3:25:30 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): too much ego and attitude and 0 skills
[14/05/18, 3:26:18 PM] Manika (pushstart): You must report. It doesn't really impact placements coz they must already be having something in their hands if they didn't turn up.
[14/05/18, 3:26:33 PM] Manika (pushstart): Agree
[14/05/18, 3:26:41 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Infact tier 2 colleges also do that
One of guy who dropped me message yesterday has offer from tcs Infosys and one start yup and he was yet looking for another offer from startup
So it’s the same across the colleges
[14/05/18, 3:27:28 PM] Jeet (pushstart): If it was internship then colleges would ban them.


If it was full time role then it’s fine if you report to.

In that case College also would be least helpful🙂
[14/05/18, 3:28:09 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Vashista Sirji, I think you have already wasted time. Since you already know that they aren't going to join you. Why waste more time?
[14/05/18, 3:28:40 PM] Manika (pushstart): But these so called tier 1 colleges also pump up the students, with unrealistic expectations when the reality is that these colleges don't show up in even the top 200 across the globe.
[14/05/18, 3:30:05 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Top 200 across globe has a lot more factors rather than student quality.

Student quality in iits is near par with best minds in top colleges across globe.


Why don’t we stand up in World ranking?

1) funding 
2) diversity
3) international students coming to study 
4) a lot more but which are more of external in nature.
[14/05/18, 3:30:59 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its cos people must understand the consequence of the action they take
[14/05/18, 3:31:24 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Agreed. But don't you feel it is a waste of time?
[14/05/18, 3:31:43 PM] Manika (pushstart): Skill too... Our colleges and sorry for saying this, esp. Engineering colleges have students for eg. Civil engineer who knows nothing about his subject. And these are fresh graduates.
[14/05/18, 3:32:05 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): it might feel that way but in the longer run, as leadership in the company we have the align and make a stand
[14/05/18, 3:32:47 PM] Anjali (pushstart): probably that isn't specific to tier 1 colleges, it is maybe the general trend so we cant label tier 1 colleges like that. If its with tier 1 colleges so it is with others too.
[14/05/18, 3:33:50 PM] Manika (pushstart): We all are human beings and it is okay to share ones feelings to a like minded group. This is called human touch. And I would say thank you for sharing coz I face this situation everytime after the campus recruitments.
[14/05/18, 3:34:09 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): most skill sets are abysmal and so off the market sync that its pointless to hire without the ability to train them, most academic courses are  soo off the mark
[14/05/18, 3:34:23 PM] Manika (pushstart): I am talking about IIT Delhi candidate, if you want me to be specific
[14/05/18, 3:35:31 PM] Manika (pushstart): Yes they are teaching some things which are totally obsolete to the job market now .
[14/05/18, 3:35:52 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i have a BITSian co founder, we hired people from BITS, IIT, DTU, NIT's NMIMS, IIMS and we have seen that most of them dont know jack shit
[14/05/18, 3:36:39 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i am sorry if i have offended bitsians and IITians here but then even you know its a fact
[14/05/18, 3:36:47 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): If you get into their shoes, you can find the answer. 😅
[14/05/18, 3:36:58 PM] Anjali (pushstart): So let's not label every student from tier 1 colleges na. If our curriculum in India is set that way, are we to be blamed?
I totally agree, hardly anything practical is taught to us. But how do we bring about a change..admin doesn't care about us
[14/05/18, 3:37:11 PM] Anjali (pushstart): +11
[14/05/18, 3:37:24 PM] Jeet (pushstart): And may be you were into that shoes once. 
So you can understand.
[14/05/18, 3:38:29 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): I haven't hired from this.

But have interacted on several occasions during my journey into Edutech.

I kind of agree
[14/05/18, 3:38:31 PM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: So it's not the college but an individuals decision to fool around....
[14/05/18, 3:38:52 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): how come only you face the issue, i see students from tier 2 and 3 college do better
[14/05/18, 3:39:11 PM] Manika (pushstart): The thing is they have so much of attitude, and know no skills.
[14/05/18, 3:39:26 PM] Bhanu Bhandari (pushstart): +1
[14/05/18, 3:39:35 PM] Anjali (pushstart): yeah the point about attitude is true...
[14/05/18, 3:40:50 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): attitude comes cos they feel cos they have entered IIT/BITS, they can own the world
[14/05/18, 3:40:53 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): I'll tell you the practical reason. In India, we love everything to be served on a platter. 

First we want 90% (and not the knowledge) then getting into IIT/NIT via FITJEE sweatshop is the fad. 

U learn tricks to solve the paper, but you don't get any depth. 

You can learn process of elimination to get the answer. 

But if you are asked a simple question where you need subjective opinion most of the engineers fail. 

I asked engineers before hiring - What is physics? 

They tell me mostly that it is a branch of science. I'm like tab bio kya h😅😂

[14/05/18, 3:41:26 PM] George (pushstart): In the long run, attitude is more important than skills 😎
[14/05/18, 3:41:56 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): So it is a vicious cycle. If you tend to deviate, there is a huge resistance from society.
[14/05/18, 3:42:01 PM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: Agree on the attitude issue
[14/05/18, 3:42:05 PM] Manika (pushstart): What an excuse!

[14/05/18, 3:44:06 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): HR is so outdated in terms of practice, they are not doing anything to actually make the life of employee better
[14/05/18, 3:44:19 PM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: 😂👌🏻👏🏻
[14/05/18, 3:45:05 PM] Manika (pushstart): That's true. 

One more thing I have discovered . After say 2 years of failed attempt to find meaning in life, these kids decide that they want to change the world. And to do so prepare for UPSC. Another 4years lost.
[14/05/18, 3:45:21 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Not all do that😰😰
[14/05/18, 3:45:42 PM] George (pushstart): Just because you dropped out from highschool doesn't mean you are a billionaire by default 💁‍♂....

[14/05/18, 3:46:19 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): True.

Good part of IITs is students are overall developed and have some extra edge on learning and implementing and they are usually smart or learn fast.


But it only happens if they could ideal you or respect u (means u need to earn that respect also)

So lot of factors lead to complexity

[20/05/18, 5:24:41 PM] Charan (ps): 👍🏼
[20/05/18, 5:25:03 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Only boys😥

[20/05/18, 5:30:38 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): 😋
[20/05/18, 5:36:10 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): you have tinder with a larger user base
[20/05/18, 5:37:38 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Tinder ke liye Paisa and abs chaiye😂
[20/05/18, 5:38:12 PM] Manav Ailawadi (pushstart): Haha thats why pushtinder😜
[20/05/18, 5:39:00 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): neeraj kya kya handle karega
[20/05/18, 5:49:52 PM] Rohan (delhips): Since everyone is talking about Tinder, why not give my app a spin ...
[20/05/18, 5:49:54 PM] Rohan (delhips): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hack.rohanagarwal94.tinderautoswiperight
[20/05/18, 5:50:03 PM] Rohan (delhips): It automatically swipes right on android
[20/05/18, 5:50:04 PM] Rohan (delhips): 😎
[20/05/18, 5:50:08 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): 😂😂😂
[20/05/18, 5:52:09 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): U can try for Tinder marketing which we discussed. 😅
[20/05/18, 5:53:36 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Why would someone do that?
[20/05/18, 5:55:26 PM] Avani Parekh (pushstart): Tinder marketing worked for my startup!
[20/05/18, 5:57:04 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Great
[20/05/18, 5:57:23 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): But how
[20/05/18, 5:58:17 PM] Rohan (delhips): You won't understand😂😂😂. The playing field is different for respective genders
[20/05/18, 5:59:08 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Why does gender comes in between
[20/05/18, 5:59:41 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): I hate gender bifurcation
[20/05/18, 6:00:05 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Though I know its inevitable
[20/05/18, 6:00:33 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Wahi karing
[20/05/18, 6:00:44 PM] Rohan (delhips): Technically, there is an imbalance in the demand supply for both of them. Guys usually swipe right on everyone, while it's the choice of the girls to choose their lot. Ask my 500 male paying subscribers.
[20/05/18, 6:01:37 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): After 100 swipes I barely get 1 match
On the other hand if a girl starts swiping right she will get 80 matches in 100 swipes.
[20/05/18, 6:01:47 PM] Rohan (delhips): Bravo
[20/05/18, 6:01:53 PM] Ankit Tibrewal (pushstart): True
[20/05/18, 6:01:55 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): This where gender comes in between
[20/05/18, 6:02:19 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): Can you shed some more light on this?
[20/05/18, 6:02:23 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Throw some.light
[20/05/18, 6:02:49 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Tinder has something called ELO score, if you swipe everyone right. It goes down and that means sub average matches.
[20/05/18, 6:03:30 PM] Manav Ailawadi (pushstart): Thats new! @919560124225 no doubt no matches for you😜
[20/05/18, 6:03:34 PM] Shubham Kashyap (pushstart): 😳
[20/05/18, 6:03:57 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Then why does tinder have an option of swipe they can just give this choice to girls or by default they can keep this option for boys other can be open to everyone
[20/05/18, 6:04:12 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Haye maa mata ji😥
[20/05/18, 6:04:17 PM] Manav Ailawadi (pushstart): Tinder is going to get heavy traffic today😛
People going to change strategy today😝
[20/05/18, 6:04:22 PM] Ankit Tibrewal (pushstart): Epic
[20/05/18, 6:04:32 PM] Shubham Kashyap (pushstart): 🤣
[20/05/18, 6:04:44 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Why to need another app for it
[20/05/18, 6:04:49 PM] Shubham Kashyap (pushstart): 😆
[20/05/18, 6:04:58 PM] Manav Ailawadi (pushstart): 😂
[20/05/18, 6:04:59 PM] Rohan (delhips): Because it pollutes their platform. There is a reason why Facebook has no dislike button even if the users want it badly.
[20/05/18, 6:05:50 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): Dislike is a negative feedback which noone likes
[20/05/18, 6:06:23 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): But by default swiping all is not negative unless girls don't get to know
[20/05/18, 6:07:11 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): And it's a fact that we girls do know how desperate boys are! 
Sorry if someone didn't like
[20/05/18, 6:07:38 PM] Ankit Tibrewal (pushstart): Epic statement
[20/05/18, 6:07:53 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Hahan well. Try "Coffee Meets Bagel"
[20/05/18, 6:08:16 PM] Rohan (delhips): And that becomes the reason why my app provides value. I don't care they are desparate. I like it as long as it pays.
[20/05/18, 6:08:25 PM] Rohan (delhips): They*
[20/05/18, 6:08:37 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Hum engineer hai Hume sab chalta h😂
[20/05/18, 6:08:39 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): What is your app?
[20/05/18, 6:08:54 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Auto liker
[20/05/18, 6:08:57 PM] Rohan (delhips): .
[20/05/18, 6:09:17 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): as long as  you  get work its okay
[20/05/18, 6:09:33 PM] Seema Sharma (pushstart): you are getting some new downloads
[20/05/18, 6:09:40 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Tbh. Doesn't works in the long term
[20/05/18, 6:09:41 PM] Rohan (delhips): 😂😂😂🙈
[20/05/18, 6:09:41 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Ohh. You don't know boys.


Its like right swipe till the limit ends. In 5 mins
[20/05/18, 6:09:55 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Tinder algorithms will detect the pattern and classify the account as a bot
[20/05/18, 6:09:57 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Apna hath jagannath🙋‍♂
[20/05/18, 6:10:06 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Punish you with fewer matches
[20/05/18, 6:10:08 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): App se tez hu me
[20/05/18, 6:10:11 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): 😂
[20/05/18, 6:10:19 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): As in?
It did help me in many ways. But marketing?
[20/05/18, 6:10:41 PM] Ankit Tibrewal (pushstart): Tinder analysis. Jabardast.
[20/05/18, 6:10:53 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): How does it work tho?

[20/05/18, 6:22:34 PM] ‪+91 91315 16523‬: Mi ju
[20/05/18, 6:22:37 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): It's about who and how you are targeting
[20/05/18, 6:23:24 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): So if you want to get to 1000 boys then swipe on every right and you will be matched with those who swipe right all the time
[20/05/18, 6:23:36 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Using a fake profile you can try that
[20/05/18, 6:23:53 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Or to get good matches try 1 right for every 9 left
[20/05/18, 6:31:32 PM] Aditya Raja (pushstart): ‎This message was deleted.

[20/05/18, 7:06:01 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): No discussion here on whatsapp and the above discussion wasn't required nor it was related. Plead avoid and refrain from such discussion
[20/05/18, 7:06:46 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): it was about tinder marketing which is a super new avenue to try
[20/05/18, 7:07:14 PM] Amit Baliga (pushstart): More information about the algo ELO?
[20/05/18, 7:10:34 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Discussion are to be done on fb not on whatsapp. Whatsapp group is made for specific reason.
[20/05/18, 7:11:26 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): so discussing about a meetup is justified but not about something specific to group members ?
[20/05/18, 7:14:49 PM] ‪+91 95821 99496‬: Dear admin,
I think you can think of laying some ground rules regarding the posting on the group. So many discussions will not lead to a quality group. 
Just a suggestion.
[20/05/18, 7:16:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Actually this group is only for seeking connections
[20/05/18, 7:16:15 PM] Neeraj Joshi: These kinds of discussions happen once in a while
[20/05/18, 7:16:24 PM] Amit Baliga (pushstart): How does one restrict just to seek connections 😑
[20/05/18, 7:16:33 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): ‎This message was deleted.
[20/05/18, 7:16:39 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): exactly !
[20/05/18, 7:16:51 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The way people are restricted from not seeking connections on the fb group
[20/05/18, 7:17:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: There is a different purpose for different channels
[20/05/18, 7:17:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *
[20/05/18, 7:17:42 PM] Amit Baliga (pushstart): IMHO forcing consumer behavior change isn't a wow thing exactly!
[20/05/18, 7:17:48 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Check the group dp bro
[20/05/18, 7:18:01 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): 👆🏽
[20/05/18, 7:18:35 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): whatever man ! all i am saying it just let things be organic not force it
[20/05/18, 7:18:50 PM] Uneza (pushstart): I do agree on this.
[20/05/18, 7:19:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We have fb group for discussions. We can’t distribute the traffic on both channels
[20/05/18, 7:20:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: The purpose of this group is different
[20/05/18, 7:20:24 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): fb group is too large, too many discussion and too much chaos happens there
[20/05/18, 7:20:30 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Pm
[20/05/18, 7:21:28 PM] Amit Baliga (pushstart): Agreed. But WhatsApp is more instinctive na, atleast for impromptu discussions?
[20/05/18, 7:22:34 PM] Amit Baliga (pushstart): For structured discussion like Tinder Marketing as a topic, FB is good but discussions involving gelling with each other here... Just thinking aloud
[20/05/18, 7:23:17 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Agreed✌sorry.
[20/05/18, 7:28:06 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): You can post same on fb too right, here 240+ members are there and not everybody likes the ping ping. Fb is free for posting discussion on any relative topic.
[20/05/18, 7:28:54 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Rules have been set after analyzing things. So please stick to the rules.
[20/05/18, 7:29:39 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): And during discussion is somebody post for help, that post gets lost in between and the person won't like it
[20/05/18, 7:32:58 PM] Amit Baliga (pushstart): 👍🏼
[20/05/18, 7:45:21 PM] Rohan (delhips): Looking to connect with security engineers who are experienced in embedded security or know of someone in the domain.

[20/05/18, 8:07:17 PM] Nitesh Manav (pushstart): Because it takes considerable time in judging people while,  usually entrepreneurs don't have time for all this. So they better think to use it after the match.
[20/05/18, 8:11:49 PM] Nitesh Manav (pushstart): 👍

[24/05/18, 8:28:54 PM] Nitesh Manav (pushstart): Not sure if the offer is still working or not, but there is a premium tool called Mailswift.io using which you can send bulk emails through Amazon SES .. go to Mailswift.io#buy and use coupon code LIFETIME to get it for $79 ( otherwise cost $749) 

Oh! Yes.. just noticed that you said free tools and no spam reporting..  there is no such whitehat tools.. since none of the real company will promote spaming if you are sending bulk emails without their consent specially after GDPR thing. And since it involves sever costs..it can't be free.
[24/05/18, 8:48:07 PM] Amit Gupta (ps): Amazon ses would not help in this case. Reason being they blacklist your account if you have 10% bounce

You all are hereby informed that the group pertains only to getting your requirements fulfilled. We are trying our level best to make it a place where all your requirements are met and we will be more thn happy if this group comes into your mind whenever you have any requirement. 
To make sure we retain good and happening members of the community, who are a very rich resource for us, we have made certain rules that are mentioned in the group picture. 

Adding to it, please follow two things more: 
1) The one who is posting a requirement also add contact details with your post on this group. This may help us get your requirements fulfilled from other PushGroups as well. 

2) All those who are helping community members in fulfillment of the requirements, please try to do it in personal message. As due to so many messages, the main messages go somewhere too above that they do not sometimes reach the right person. The main motive is to reduce chatting on this group. 

PushThanks
PushRegards

As a screening associate partner to them... I can help you guys get the funds to fuel your dream products...Currently the focus is only on the startups that already have traction.. ( not an idea stage )... The main areas that can reach out for now are :
[01/06/18, 5:13:38 PM] Charan (ps): (1) AI
(2) Bio-tech
(3) Weapon
(4) Logistic 
(5) (i don't know what to call this) Bringing rural people online.

(6) Then there's high-tractions B2B/C businesses.


No AR/VR techs, No buzzword filler startups, No social-media startups.

Hello #pushstarters, 
We've been working on our startup - AIMagnifi Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (www.aimagnifi.com) for around a year now. And, now we are very close to launching our very first product SkippQ (www.skippq.com). We are trying to make the offline shopping experience seamless by making you skip the long queues. Currently, we are running a crowdfunding campaign to finish the development process of our application. We have few customers onboard and we want to deliver the best. Also, the most funded startups will get a chance to enter the pitching round in front of India's top investors/VCs panel. 
To make our dreams into reality we need your support. Please have a look at the campaign and support us - https://www.catapooolt.com/skippq

"Be an Enabler, You're Helping Create New Things!"


PS: We have successfully raised Rs. 64639 in less than a week and now, need few more steps to reach out our targeted amount! I would be glad if, you can contribute/donate a bit to accomplish our goal! 🙂

Looking forward to your kind support! If you can't help monetary then please feel free to share among your friends/social media to help us achieve goal.

Also, the term was used by British, (ref: Vernacular press act) to refer to and suppress media in Indian languages, specially those criticising the then govt.

We observed few problems like,
1. Overpriced personal trainers 💰
2. Underqualified gym trainer along with lack of attention 😞
3. The science behind a personalized meal or workout plan is not possible by an individual to knowledge and time constraints 🤯
4. Overwhelmed and confused with too many online videos/trainers/blogs etc 🤔
We would like to address this problem with help of the personal virtual assistant which is best at its job, cheaper and always with you to understand your needs 🤖

We would like you to spare few minutes to fill out the survey to understand your problems and adoption of virtual assistance for an ultimate long-term solution 😎

[22/06/18, 5:23:50 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Hello guys Harshal Shroff here, After running and exiting my operations of 18 outlets and retaining the brand of This Corn,I visited my home town(Chinchani in Palaghar district) after 8yrs of living in Mumbai, I see that not much has changed here apart from the fact that people consume more data(Due to JIO and the current data based marketing) on their phone and are slowly getting aware about "The power of internet and connected lives" it's more like electricity, which still has power cuts in many rural areas. It's been a overwhelming experience of starting up once and humbling to exit and start once again.

However, Schools and bussiness dont see the value of data connections, and even if they do.. complete connectivity becomes an issue due to unstable Network performance.

In the comming one month i am LOOKING to connect and speak with people interested to build multilingual and affordable ways to bring 4G/5G broadband and connect applications to Rural India with "wireless street level WIFI connectivity, based on renewable POWER solutions to effective ways to deliver digital access to people with incomes less than 10k/month

If you are interested or are connected to people/startups who focus on this area do help me connect, we are also looking to connect with affordable Telecom equipment manufacturers and Network infrastructure creators.

Ideally ex-employees of companies like Telenor india, Storeking,Airjaldi,Aervoyce, Wifi Dababa, Digital empowerment foundation or people in the government helping digital india movement in the RURAL areas

Currently we are preparing to build an application for applying for a CLASS A or a Unified, Virtual Network Operator (VNO) licence.

Our Aim is to build
-Robust cheap wireless street level connectivity infrastructure
-Delivering NEW experiences and products to Rural India in affordable ways
- Delivering sachet(Under 50INR) size data,learning,insurance and investment solutions.

[25/06/18, 12:29:52 PM] Ruchi Sharma (pushstart): ThatMate is a social enterprise focused on the sexual education of  children for topics and subject matter that is usually avoided because of cultural barriers. ... The key focus of ThatMate is to diminish the taboo tied to these topics. ... Together, let us trump the taboo. We provide workshops as well comic books to teach in gender sensitive, neutral ways. 
Can anyone put me in touch with schools who might be interested to go forward or NGO who would like to collaborate.

[29/06/18, 11:02:32 PM] Amanjot (pushstart): How can one increase user retention on Digital Wallet like Mobikwik?
Please share thoughtful ideas, this is for a case study. What all features will help in doing that?
[29/06/18, 11:12:16 PM] Zenith (ps): Stating the obvious: Increase the number of places it is accepted
[29/06/18, 11:12:58 PM] Zenith (ps): Are you talking about internal app features or simply anything that would increase user retention?
[29/06/18, 11:19:05 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Introduce a new category that is under valued and offer higher discounts subsidized by an obvious customer. 

PAYTM partnership with golmaal during Diwali was a great one and than BMS with secret superstar. 

Obviously PAYTM tied up with Pvr at 20cr deposit with BMS giving only 5k ...more details in  PM.
[29/06/18, 11:19:42 PM] Amanjot (pushstart): both, anything that could increase that

[29/06/18, 11:21:49 PM] Amanjot (pushstart): okay, you mean to suggest a quick customer support
[29/06/18, 11:22:22 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Tez ki case study dekhi hai sir?
[29/06/18, 11:22:28 PM] Neeraj Joshi: check it out
[29/06/18, 11:25:13 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): 1. Cashback I receive should be transferable to bank(I think all would love this feature - Ixigo was doing it initially)
2. Whatever money I have in any of the wallet should not have any restrictions on next subsequent use.
[29/06/18, 11:29:44 PM] Amanjot (pushstart): plz share
[29/06/18, 11:30:01 PM] Amanjot (pushstart): haven`t read the case study
[29/06/18, 11:30:21 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Both are open to exploting. Loyalty wise its a burner. The aim is to have sustainaned audience not a fickle one.
[29/06/18, 11:30:43 PM] Amanjot (pushstart): See, wallet system is going to end very soon. you have UPI based app and then you will have banks
[29/06/18, 11:31:14 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Wallets are dead anyways. It's now payments bank accounts.
[29/06/18, 11:32:37 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Upi ftw
[29/06/18, 11:33:19 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Upi 2 will be a game changer, and will make wallets obsolete
[29/06/18, 11:35:46 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): But that's what Atleast attract customer , right ?
[29/06/18, 11:36:04 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): And first step is to attract and then retain 😁
[29/06/18, 11:37:37 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): It's short term and doesn't lead to time spent. It leaves the marketing cashflow NEGATIVE. Undoubtedly get u the numbers, but looses the brand intangible which is more than the numbers :)
[29/06/18, 11:41:05 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Also it's ALWAYS better to get a new category, it makes you money in the long term if u plug a gap. And offer a value offer. I.e Vodafone Tuesday. Or blackberry boys. 

Or fastag or donations or the hottest category being infrastructure service payments in Cash only cites/categories.
[30/06/18, 9:51:53 AM] Neeraj Joshi: [Long Read] - Invite for Social Samosa's LIVE Conference

The team at Social Samosa is excited to pay a tribute to the medium which is a driving factor for the evolution, existence and sustenance of quite a lot of Brands, Agencies, Publishers, Platforms, and Creators!

When we set out to recreate the #SMLive Magic this year, I was told 8 Million People and 2 Lac+ Video Views were possible in 2017 and it's a tough nut to crack considering the friendly NewsFeed algorithm.

As ambitious as it may sound, riding high in the faith and power of our community of Marketers, Agency Professionals, Creators, and Practitioner we are all set to take the challenge and breach the circles of virality with #SMLive2018

We plan to kick-start the day with a Keynote Address from one of the pioneers in Indian Advertising and Marketing Industry - Mr. Ashish Bhasin

Taking the baton from him C-Suite Advisor and Power Influencer - Tanvi Gautam will take us through the essentials of Building an Authentic Personal Brand on Social Media

Anoushka Adya, Rashi Ray and Mounica Tata DoodleODrama will discuss on how Social Media has emerged as a great tool to enable Women Empowerment

This is just the beginning; next up we have Kainaz Karmakar  and Harshad Rajadhyaksha from the team which managed to win Ogilvy India's first CANNES Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness this year with Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks. They will speak about the LITTLE they know about Great Advertising!

A lot has been spoken about the various applications of Data across, Ashish Tiwari will share a different perspective on Data-Driven Storytelling to craft the right message

Chandramohan Mehra from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will bring in the flavor of Hyper Current and Topical Content with anecdotes from their collaboration with Dabbu The Dancer aka The Dancing Uncle

Threading thoughts from being responsive and customer-centric at all points in time, Vineet Singh will share Quick Social CRM Hacks to win over audiences

Mr. Bean from the Indian Digital Industry, Nitin Bhatia will enunciate the importance and relevance of Data in the value chain

Shifting Gear towards some Creator Tales, Ranveer Allahbadia - The Beer Biceps will share his story on carving a niche amongst the content clutter

The Master Storyteller behind some of the most engaging original content from Kingfisher, Sandeep Balan will draw parallels between Branded Content and Original Content

Over the past few years, Wittyfeed has become one of the largest Viral Content Companies and Parveen Singhal will share Growth Hacking Lessons in the process of building this new age company

Nidhi Bisht and Sarjita Jain from India's Leading Women Content Channel will sum up the #SMLive2018 show with a talk on Creating Entertainment for Women with Brands

That's the amazing lineup we have been talking about ever since we launched the initiative this year; as we strive to raise the bar and make this BIGGER & BETTER we are counting on your support to make this happen!

Come and join us to Celebrate #WorldSocialMedia Day

- Show Interest/Attendance to the event here bit.ly/SMLive2018

- Engage with our esteemed speakers who are sparing out time on a Saturday for this cause

- Share your favorite sessions within the network and shower some love using #SMLive2018

Here's wishing you all a very Happy #WorldSocialMedia Day!

Cheers!

[30/06/18, 10:02:21 AM] Zenith (ps): 1. India is a price sensitive market - aim at giving cashbacks wherever other wallets are, and more
2. The funnel needs be crisp - the number of steps between installing the app to loading money to using it need to be the shortest
3. In case of wallets: your most important metric is "load money"

I handled Oxygen Wallet's marketing for quite some time. You can PM me in case you have a specific question :)

I quit using Mobikwik and am unlikely to use it regardless of whatever freebie/offers they give me.
Some of their concepts - like Supercash, low withdrawal limits, and some other baffling restrictions are as anti-customer as it gets. The supercash system in particular is what completed my transition out of mobikwik. 

And then the CEO has the audacity to demand government protection against foreign funded cos like paytm.
Baffling.

[26/07/18, 4:40:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: #PushUpdate #PushAMA #PushLaunch 
Our first Product Launch+AMA on Pushstart by founder of Wild Earth. 

Ask her anything and everything related to her journey and brand Wild Earth <3 <3 

Shabia Ravi Walia, Founder and Owner of 'Wild Earth' is a media professional for the past 24 years.﻿ 

'Wild Earth' was born out of Shabia's fears of what she put on her baby's body after she became a mother. 

The labels scared her and the fact that she did not understand what went into the products made her uncomfortable. 

Being the solution driven person she is, Shabia started making soaps and lotions in her own kitchen.  

Soon word spread and mothers were demanding her to make the full range. Her experiments proved to be a huge hit with everyone and soon she was forced to move from her kitchen to a proper office and workshop

Today Shabia is proud to have created a brand that provides natural quality products which young, old and babies can use without any fear of side effects of harsh chemicals.

'Wild Earth' today sells online, thru retail stores, is a huge gifting opting for corporates and is exported to quite a few foreign countries, purely on the basis of its quality and the pure intention behind the brand, an intention that was born from a mothers heart and not in a business school.

It is a competition to be held in Thailand on September 23, 2018 as part of the larger Digital Thailand Big Bang event, which I will be attending. It aims to attract and empower entrepreneurs from around the world, helping them grow their business ideas, connecting them to investors and global markets, and strengthening their innovative capabilities to the benefit of the food industry supply chain and society.

[05/08/18, 8:53:03 AM] Akash (pushstart): Good Morning Pushstarters! Happy Friendship Day to all. 
In between the reviews and ratings, I am searching some case studies where I someone got helped in such a way that it was huge in his or her perspective. Like i have seen so many people getting jobs because of Pushstart, legal or accounting help and so on. 

One more thing. So many people are inactive and are somewhere at a stage they are about to start. I think you should start coming to PushMeetups too, that really helped me. 

I got some amazing tips before execution of my startup Groomers from people like Nitin Sethi Sir and Amit Rohra Sir. It really helped. What about your views on Pushmeetups guys??
[05/08/18, 9:03:43 AM] Mukesh Sharma (ps): @916263485557 are you guys going Pushmeetups in NCR also ??

[07/08/18, 9:47:18 PM] Neeraj Joshi: #PushAmA #ImpromptuAmA
AMA: All of us have constant questions about the deep (dark?) world of VC funding or investments in general across different levels (Seed to Growth). 

Today, as discussed with Neeraj Joshi, I am doing an AMA to answer any of your queries in and around this topic. 

About me: I have been a global investor and a serial entrepreneur, with multiple successful exits and investments across countries, using my roles as founder of a VC firm while being Advisor to a number of others. 

I take pride in building multi-million dollar companies, Great Manager Institute being the recent one. I run quite a few companies in different geographies. 

I am NOT an expert. I am just a learner and a perennial student. 

Follow the link to become part of the AMA.

[07/08/18, 10:28:03 PM] Siddharth Gangal (pushstart): Think it's one of Whatsapp's new policies to combat spread of fake news, etc by limiting sharing capability of app.
[07/08/18, 10:30:08 PM] Lakshya (pushstart): Yes!
[07/08/18, 10:31:05 PM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): Yes it is WhatsApp new strategy though it is limiting us to share daily price update to our regular customer via WhatsApp

[07/08/18, 10:33:30 PM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): It is not a good work around as it limits the information sharing to new leads about your company.

In broadcasting, the person needs to have your number saved for message to be delivered

[15/08/18, 6:55:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi All! Posting on behalf of The Goa Project (TGP).

The Goa Project is an annual “unconference” that brings together a diverse set of people from various fields – to converse, collaborate and co-create. The entire agenda is crowdsourced, leading to two exciting days of talks, workshops, presentations, pitches and interventions. Run completely by volunteers who are passionate about cross-sector learning, collaboration and ideas.

The sixth edition of TGP will happen on the 26-27th of Oct at a secret location that's NOT Goa! Yes you heard that right. We're also launching a week long (19-25th Oct, 2018) fully-funded TGP Residency where business owners, makers, thinkers, do-ers will be matched with inter-disciplinary collaborators bringing in an opportunity for both venture owners & collaborators to work on innovative solutions! 

This is where you come in! TGP is looking to reach out to exceptional venture-owners who will bring interesting flavors to the residency (they're also looking to find equally interesting collaborators, but more on that on a later date) and for this, included below are the application and more information links. We urge you to apply right away (deadline is 18th Aug), if you know someone who could benefit from this too, do spread the word to them as well!

Application link:  https://goo.gl/forms/ebqciZ1NTJf3oasZ2
More details on the residency: http://www.thegoaproject.com/eligibility-criteria/ 
FAQs: http://www.thegoaproject.com/faqs/ 

If you think you'd make an awesome volunteer instead, apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/ZpBmUvsQYv4IGQ8F2 

Appreciate the help!
Thanks!

Thanks for taking the time to go over my CV. We have just recently spoken over LinkedIn. You can forward the following to interested people:

I looking for fulltime positions only. My current CTC is 17 lakh + commissions + benefits. My expected CTC is 25 lakh + commissions.


As discussed, I am an American expat looking for a job.  I have spent the last 8 years in India. I have worked in Sales & Marketing areas. I am looking for an opportunity where my American origin and Indian culture exposure can be leveraged, to minimize communication gap between international clients for Indian companies.



I have experience in the software services industry, and have worked as a cofounder of a bootstrapped startup. I am best suited for a software services or software product company with overseas clients. This can be either in Sales, Business Requirement analysis, or Product Management.



Please let me know if you come across any such opportunities. My number is 7722086168, what's a good day and time to chat to discuss this in more detail?



Best,

Yan

[17/08/18, 9:52:47 PM] Priyanka Deo (ps): Speaker Prompt
There are several ways to go about it. Your 4-7 minute monologue must have personal insights and also tie in your story as an entrepreneur/professional/student in India. 

We will have a small intro which I will compile & finalize with you tomorrow. This intro will be read right before you speak, so you don't need to include this in your 4-7 minutes.

Remember, it is open mic which is way more casual than a formal speech- so have fun with it! The people want to know about you and your story :)  

Write your monologue around the following topics: 

1. Just a few years ago, being an entrepreneur was a term that was not something to be proud of in India. Now the term is lauded. How has this helped you evolve as an entrepreneur? 
2. How do you handle your personal/professional life? What is the hardest part and how do you deal with it?
3. Many government efforts now push for entrepreneurship which carry the mantra, 'why take jobs when you can create jobs?' How do you fit into this energy? 
4. What is the biggest struggle you have faced in your professional life and how have you overcome it? 
5. Now, there are many efforts that India is making to finance and support entrepreneurs. How have you leveraged that with your company?

Guys, question.. if u were to begin something in technology sector, would you choose Delhi over other places like Pune Bangalore? How is the availability of talent, when it comes to programming, coding, ui ux etc in general in Delhi? I work for a construction tech company and we are exploring our options on where we should establish an office for the same. Me being from Delhi, i prefer it. But it also needs to be viable from talent and economic standpoint.. what do you guys think?

[21/08/18, 8:45:53 AM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): There is definitely a dearth of good tech talent in NCR. You will have to undertake a lot of headhunting.. but if your network is in NCR than in Bangalore or Pune, then this is the place to be.

My rating (out of 10)
1. Economic standpoint:
Pune-10, Banglore-6, Delhi-5
2. Talent:
Pune-8, Bangalore-10,Delhi-7

[21/08/18, 8:52:00 AM] Kumar Mayank (pushstart): Attracting talent from other cities is not an issue. But as a startup founder you tend to be wary of the risks of getting people from other cities

[25/08/18, 12:46:25 PM] Amit Pandey (pushstart): Please share  brief intro about you
[25/08/18, 1:32:52 PM] ‪+91 99719 18300‬: Hello All,

I am Gagan Sahni & I design for Humans. I'm passionate about creating products,  overcoming obstacles that occur along  the journey and make users happier and more productive with their work.

I’m an Independent UX consultant driven by curiosity, compassion and dissatisfaction. I spend most days contemplating the design of a more thoughtful world. I work with both small startups and hugely successful companies, build seriously cool products for them & help their customers.

"My goal is straight forward... always put the user first by turning complex processes into simple, meaningful and engaging experiences. The rest will fall into place."

What matters to me the most is to create engaging, memorable and playful user experiences that are simple, useful, usable and fun to interact with. If you’re building a digital product or service and are looking for someone with over a decade of experience in design,

 Let's Talk !

[07/09/18, 3:29:41 PM] ‪+91 90087 90081‬: Hey guys
Need some insights.

If people bet on an event of sport.. lets say in a particular match, if Ronaldo will score a goal..?

They have to pay a fees to enter the competition and if they win they get some reward in cash/kind.

Want to know the legality of this 'betting' scenario in India.

[07/09/18, 3:32:06 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Thanks
[07/09/18, 3:35:25 PM] Akant Baretha (pushstart): Not legal.. any betting whether it will rain today or who wins the election or 3-patti is illegal under section 3 PGA. Still people pursue through sites like Betfair & Bet365 online. That's their take as UK online laws govern these sites.

[15/09/18, 12:01:58 AM] Ashu (pushstart): I think the most misunderstood and broad topic could possibly be "how people may attract their first pool of users to their apps"
[15/09/18, 12:04:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: We have already organised it. It was by Sujan Patel
[15/09/18, 12:08:36 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Anyone looking to target mothers and kids Or local offline marketing?

My mom is hosting an event on 22nd Oct. Near Diwali.

If anyone is interested in in stalls or sponsorship let me know.

Min expected footfall : 2k

Target audience : Mom's and kids.
[15/09/18, 12:09:16 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Yet, many people still gets confused over the topic. May be it was just enough for the members? That's my opinion. I get many messages with one discussion and that's around gaining users. Especially app ones.

I've even seen the comments and suggestions in past ama's added by other hosts.
Don't take it otherwise but i found most of them to be generic and were much in the air rather being case specific
[15/09/18, 12:09:25 AM] Ashu (pushstart): @918779219493
[15/09/18, 12:09:52 AM] Ashu (pushstart): *was not just enough, i mean. Sorry. Typos!
[15/09/18, 12:11:48 AM] Neeraj Joshi: What should we do to make them more specific?
[15/09/18, 12:12:44 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Umm.. what was the last ama about? When you say gaining users? Was it all about direct businesses? Or about everything and anything?
[15/09/18, 12:14:05 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Have we covered any ama over hardware building? @918779219493 m
[15/09/18, 12:14:06 AM] Ashu (pushstart): ?
[15/09/18, 12:15:42 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Not till now bro. Don’t really know whether pushstarters will be interested for it. I am planning to do on offline marketing
[15/09/18, 12:16:23 AM] Tushar Gulati (ps): If anything like this is planned in future, I would like to add up my experience as well....
[15/09/18, 12:16:39 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Why wouldn't anyone be interested to go over the Hardware side of the ecosystem?
[15/09/18, 12:17:09 AM] ‪+91 98888 69616‬: I too have the same doubt
[15/09/18, 12:18:21 AM] Neeraj Joshi: So what should be the topic and who should be the host according to you guys?
[15/09/18, 12:18:44 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Lets do it then!🔥🔥
[15/09/18, 12:19:20 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Zomato ke marketing head ko bulao Bhai.
They are killing in the offline marketing space.
Creative hoardings and what not
[15/09/18, 12:21:37 AM] Tushar Gulati (ps): I think we can have multiple topics if we are talking about hardware 

1. Design thinking process (common for every aspect of hardware/software product)

2. Automation (Ashutosh would be the best person in that case) 

3. Importance of Product/ Industrial Design for any product

4. Production sourcing, parameters to be taken care of when doing so. 

These were random topics I could think of
[15/09/18, 12:22:27 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Tushar Gulati, as he said he can do that. I can always be something like assistant host or whatever we call it.

Topic could be something like,  "using nuts and bolts to build unique businesses"

Or 

"Playing around with hardware and scaling from prototype to 100 sellable units"
[15/09/18, 12:24:02 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Let me think about it and fix something up. What about physical products?
[15/09/18, 12:24:22 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Which are not that tech tech
[15/09/18, 12:25:00 AM] Tushar Gulati (ps): Design thinking... 
This topic holds good for any kind of product
[15/09/18, 12:25:19 AM] Ashu (pushstart): There seldom are any Hardware products that doesn't make use of tech tech sir.
[15/09/18, 12:25:46 AM] Ashu (pushstart): + prototyping and scaling. I think that makes a perfect combo
[15/09/18, 12:26:10 AM] Tushar Gulati (ps): Agreed
[15/09/18, 12:28:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I am talking about physical products and not specifically hardware products
[15/09/18, 12:29:17 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Umm.. not really sure what are those products that you are implying to?
[15/09/18, 12:31:15 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Every physical thing which is not hardware
[15/09/18, 12:32:03 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Sabun se lekar chocolate tak brother
[15/09/18, 12:33:27 AM] Tushar Gulati (ps): Ya ya.... 
So let us find a way where we can align the hardware tech with physical products
[15/09/18, 12:36:31 AM] Ashu (pushstart): Ummm.. i think that would be a bad idea.
When we talk about hardware startups, people generally align themselves with technology without being specifically implied.

Plus, physical products that doesn't really qualify under the tech hardware tag gets classified into some different category.

Mixing the two might not fully delivery the detailed value.
That's what i think.
[15/09/18, 12:37:48 AM] Ashu (pushstart): These products generally are classified as FMCG. Fast consumer products with low price values.

So far from what tech hardware startups these days do.
[15/09/18, 12:38:40 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes I would agree with that for sure
[15/09/18, 12:41:12 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Will do both of them separately :) @919910335395

I am reaching out because we (my friends) are looking for someone to take on some of our embedded tech needs as the guy we have can't dedicate enough hours to finish in our needed timeline.  An overview and some details are below. The timeline is EXTREMELY tight at this point so looking for a small miracle.



Below is a brief intro on Vessel and overview of project needs.

Vessel Works is a non-profit and social impact venture that has innovated a solution to the paper cup problem. 58-billion paper cups are landfilled annually in the US alone; this is 158 million paper cups every day. At Vessel, we combine a library style service with sophisticated tracking technology in order to eliminate the need for paper and plastic to-go cups as well as provide quantified-self information to consumers regarding the impact of their everyday choices.


More details over Email.

Deadline of project completion is 28th September.

Send me your email id.

I'm Shikha, handling Marketing in RedCarpet (www.redcarpetup.com) google funded, YC S15 fintech startup. We are taking a long shot on empowering college students financially. We provide easy credits to students in 25+ cities.

*Currently on our 100k user base and network in 200+ colleges, we're starting with the following topics-*

1) Digital marketing,
2) Entrepreneurship,
3) How to get an internship,
4) Credit wallets and EMI 

We have done a pilot run already in Delhi NCR. (bit.ly/RedConnectatDRC) Had Chanchal Raj (in.linkedin.com/mrchanchalraj) - who has been instrumental in shaping digital marketing for companies like Texas Instruments, HDFC Bank, Online Tyari and is starting a startup EduPrefer as the speaker on the topic Entrepreneurship and Digital marketing.

My two pence.. 
1. Trademark doesn't necessarily mean you own the brand name. Check for MCA if the company was registered before the trademark

just wondering how many of you have content creation/social media interns and what all do they help you with? If unpaid, what do you offer in return?
[17/10/18, 11:15:08 AM] ‪+91 96543 16789‬: What is your product/service?
[17/10/18, 11:15:32 AM] Shraddha Bhalla (pushstart): I have a Fashion and Travel Blog
[17/10/18, 11:20:17 AM] ‪+91 96543 16789‬: If you need quality experience, you need to make them believe in the vision of the company i.e. you are doing something disruptive. This keeps them motivated that they’ll be promoted and offered better opportunities.

Second of all, you keep a performance incentive. If you have 10 interns, top 2 will be paid. With this all 10 would work hard but you’ll pay for only 2
[17/10/18, 11:20:20 AM] Shubham Kashyap (pushstart): +1
[17/10/18, 11:21:30 AM] ‪+91 96543 16789‬: 3. You try to find students who haven’t done such internship before. They’ll do anything and everything because it would be there first experience.
[17/10/18, 11:22:15 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Not fair.
[17/10/18, 11:22:31 AM] Jeet (pushstart): And never make someone work fr free.

Give them what they deserve.
[17/10/18, 11:23:10 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Offer them something that is really substantial.
[17/10/18, 11:23:50 AM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): 1) You can give them flexibility of doing work at home, flexible hours to keep motivated. Hire more to bridge the gap between your requirements and supply 

2) If you can hire one or two guy for a full-time job after internship, you can mention that

3) You can also target for 3-4 year college students (in case of btech ) that actually plans their travel in last year ( a plus for you) and in need of experience letter for thier upcoming placement season. Provide a experience letter if you can
[17/10/18, 11:25:36 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Why not ? Sorry to butt in
[17/10/18, 11:26:12 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): I don't pay stipend to my interns at first cos I provide them a chance to learn a lot, which has a lot more value
[17/10/18, 11:31:50 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): If you are making money because of your interns pay them.
[17/10/18, 11:32:10 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): If they don't add any value to your company why do you even have them?
[17/10/18, 11:32:43 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Legally you arent allowed to make them work for free and if you are makig them learn it isnt that they arent helping you earn some bucks or save time.
[17/10/18, 11:32:51 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Exactly
[17/10/18, 11:32:57 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): If they do add any value, value will fetch an ROI, hence $
[17/10/18, 11:34:21 AM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): There are alot of media blogs in DU which make students work for free and make $$ off ads
It's only fair to give at least 1k as a stipend or like @919662915070 told me earlier he got them freelancing opportunities
[17/10/18, 11:34:27 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Actually I can do that legally, in my case once they have enough skills to make impact, I give them part time employment and then pay, but 0 experience freshers don't get paid
[17/10/18, 11:35:04 AM] ‪+91 96543 16789‬: Most of these interns are freshers so you need to teach them each and every thing. You need to count the effort you are putting in for their learnings as well.
[17/10/18, 11:35:10 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): And I give them opportunities to earn and grow cos that way it's a good learning curve for them
[17/10/18, 11:35:40 AM] ‪+91 76784 50941‬: best starting a company i interned at different places ,

The one most important thing for interns is to give them a substantial amount of responsibility, 

if they feel they’re actually adding value they’ll work harder.

Then paying them becomes a non issue

[17/10/18, 11:39:45 AM] ‪+91 96543 16789‬: Btw guys if you are planning to seek some interns, we are organising Delhi University’s biggest Internship Fair on 25th October.

[17/10/18, 11:56:12 AM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): By which law? I have worked with Tata, honda, ISIE in my college days for free for experience only.
[17/10/18, 12:00:54 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Indian labour laws
[17/10/18, 12:03:59 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Doesn't apply to interns
[17/10/18, 12:04:05 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Go check it up
[17/10/18, 12:04:07 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): No bal majuri😏
[17/10/18, 12:05:22 PM] Shashank Agarwal (ps): And companies like Honda, Tata are not aware of the same! 

Let me read those. 👍🏻
[17/10/18, 12:05:24 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Also there is a difference in being not able to pay them and being cheap.

If you get a value and still don't pay them you are just being cheap. But if you tell them that you can't afford to pay them and they still work with is because you are a good leader. And a good leader first pays his team and cares about them and then take a pay check
[17/10/18, 12:05:33 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): If your interns are registered employees of your firm, you need to pay a minimum wage according to the Indian labor law
[17/10/18, 12:05:59 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): You guys don't pay it because most of them don't show it in the book of records and the ministry also is not strict
[17/10/18, 12:06:16 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): In Karnataka, one firm was charged with heavy fine for not paying the minimum wage!
[17/10/18, 12:06:19 PM] Abhishek Mishra (pushstart): I guess this is for second time we all are giving discussion on this topic.
[17/10/18, 12:06:20 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): It's been 2 months and I haven't taken a single buck and I pay my team from my pockets.
[17/10/18, 12:06:23 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Exactly
[17/10/18, 12:06:39 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Coz I saw it now..:)
[17/10/18, 12:07:06 PM] Jeet (pushstart): People are not valuing people and then talking about creating great firms.

No firm was ever created great by manipulating the laws and using people.
[17/10/18, 12:08:07 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Is Google and other big firms fool to pay interns? 

They can get far more quality, better ppl to work for free than other startups, but still they pay.
[17/10/18, 12:08:49 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Bingo! So true! I agree with Vaibhav as well.
If you can't pay because you seriously don't have money, let them know..:)
[17/10/18, 12:09:11 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): There is a difference in quality and skill set, I pay once they can justify the earning but with 0 skills and 0 experience, I take out time to train and teach
[17/10/18, 12:10:21 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Can file a case and get hefty returns since now you kmow😛😛
[17/10/18, 12:17:38 PM] Ayush Gupta (ps): Can someone connect or willing to collaborate for South Asia's Biggest School Robotics Competition to be held in Delhi in Mid December? Any leads would be highly appreciated.

[17/10/18, 1:07:42 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Also when we are discussing about internships. The problem I faced was incompetency and unprofessional behavior of interns.

Instead of everything trying to help them find opportunities, train them or help them be fit for an opportunity. Basic professional courtesy, and soft skills.

[01/11/18, 12:56:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha pm ;)
[01/11/18, 2:59:15 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Hi Pushstarters, congratulations on building together a thriving startup community in India. I have been a part of Pushstart for quite some time now and have seen numerous launches of some great products and have scooped brains behind those products. 

I am a product marketing manager for a small but fast growing B2E business. We have a product that we have been using internally for sometime now to streamline the devops process within the organisation and it has been quite fruitful for us. We plan to launch it for other people in the community to get them started with devops quickly and intuitively. But for that I need some feedback from you guys.

Just some questions to understand your team’s pain points and overall outlook at the devops process within your organisation.

If you build, manage and deploy release pipelines within your organisation, or anything remotely associated with devops. I would love to hear you out and ask you a few questions.

Here’s the link to reach me out on Whatsapp: http://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=918527464661
[01/11/18, 3:19:53 PM] ‪+91 85277 64164‬: Hey Varun . I did some devops and designed scalable systems for various companies . Shooting a DM would love to connect
[01/11/18, 3:48:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Anyone can connect me with the founding team of inshorts? Kindly dm. ♥️♥️
[01/11/18, 4:17:07 PM] Varun Mehra (pushstart): Great.
[01/11/18, 4:27:06 PM] Sarvottma (ps): To all wonderful PushFamily Members from Delhi and NCR. 

How many of you are able to relate your journey with any point below:
1) Many Startup Founders, especially who are core techie, have built amazing products but are not able to Sell it due to undefined Sales Process. 
2) Recruiting & Managing Sales Team is a big challange with most of the startups. 
3) Nearly 60% of sales leaders ranked sales conversations as the most important factor in creating competitive differentiation. (And you also believe the same)
4) Most of us wish to get rid of wasting time on prospects and face difficulty in finding qualified leads. 
5) Challenges faced while doing sales demotivate us and even sometimes make us doubt our products. 

We at Groomers are starting our Nano Degree Program on Sales Management with Year Long Assistance from Domain Relevant Industry Experts. This educational course is specifically designed keeping in mind the above points. 

We are organising our First FREE Demo Class in Creator's Gurukul, DLF Phase 2, Gurgaon on 18th November 2018.

[24/11/18, 7:19:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!                                                                           

*Where to Apply?*

*And that's why the change!*
[02/12/18, 1:25:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *What is the Change?*

FB Group would be more relevant for them to learn, pursue entrepreneurship and then become eligible to join this group.
