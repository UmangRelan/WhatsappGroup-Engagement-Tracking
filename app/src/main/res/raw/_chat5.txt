[27/04/18, 10:30:02 AM] ‪+91 94948 58694‬: Hello *Pushstarters*, 

This is *Rajesh*. Nice to connect with you all. Hope you all are doing great. I would love to know what you all are up to these days.

Coming to me, I'm passionate about communities, startups, non-profits and coworking spaces.

I previously founded Saakshar, a non-profit which used to work in the education space.

I would always be found reading something or the other in the Pocket App, watching videos on YouTube and forging relationships with new people.

I'll be moving to Hyderabad by the end of this month and I'll be joining as Business Development Manager at TalkADoc.

Know a couple of people in this group already. @919930800913 @918779219493 @918978043354 

Looking forward to knowing more about you all.

Thanks,
Rajesh *Let's talk more* Mummaneni.

[02/05/18, 7:34:13 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Thanks bro
[02/05/18, 11:22:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So I have been asked and told multiple times to allow discussions on the WhatsApp group and I don’t really encourage that. 

The reason is: 

I want maximum pushstaters to become part of the discussion and get benefitted:  
 
3 type of people become part of the discussion: 
1. The one who starts it: 1%  
2. The one who contributes: 4% 
3. The one who reads and learn: 95% 

If things are discussed on WhatsApp group: 
Total strength: 250 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 250 

On FB group: 
Strength: 8k 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 8k 

See the difference? 

The information shared in the discussion is priceless and a larger impact will be created if we can funnel all of it to the FB group. 

That's why: 
1. Share Idea
2. Launch Startup 
3. Ask Questions 
4. Share Content 

ON FB GROUP 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/Pushstarter

So let's impact the lives of thousands of entrepreneurs by doing all the discussions on the FB group. 

Thanks

My question is -

[03/05/18, 6:03:13 PM] Chetan Kulkarni (pushstart): Entry Barrier for Digital Marketing is Zero. Most of the people have laptop and internet by the end of their graduation. That's why every Tom, Dick and Harry is opening and claiming they are Digital Marketing Agency.

The biggest thing missing in Digital Marketing is MARKETING. Lot more to rant.

Anyway, What's great is subjective.

The best way to outgrow others, or even the good ones is to start building a brand for yourselves. 

Use the same tactics you would like to provide as a service for your own growth. Document (Video) it and document every projects and let the people see. Your work will talk.

Local Businesses don't invest much. They pay peanuts, and they lack the knowledge of how things work. Many think digital marketing is very easy. So they end up hiring Ramesh and Suresh.

If you would like to know any specifics let me know.

[09/05/18, 5:29:30 AM] ‪+91 99895 00221‬: Thanks Bhavik! Hello Pushstarters! Very excited to be part of this exclusive Hyderabad Pushstart Group! To Introduce, I’m Shravan Kore, based out of Hyderabad and have Co-Founded an Technology Consulting Firm ‘Resource Informatics Group, Inc’ back in 2012 & grew it from few hundreds of $$ to $9Mil. 

Using all the experiences of Technology hiring & understanding US Immigration laws, we want to guide companies in the US to maintain fair hiring practices & avoid the abuse of H-1B program. This lead me to Co-Found ‘OnBlick.com’ a SaaS platform that brings together best of Job Aggregation + ATS + HR Compliance for companies to find technology resources and do end to end hiring along the guidelines of USCIS Immigration laws. 

Beginning this year we went live & started OnBoarding customers to our platform generating a revenue close to $200K.

I’m very excited to see the synergies Pushstart is brining into startup communities all around. Very interested to collaborate, explore new ideas & contribute to the community. 

Thanks to Neeraj for making this group possible & getting introduced to all you wonderful people!

[06/06/18, 2:32:50 PM] Dheeraj (pushstart): The only school I would trust for advertising, is MICA. And definitely not remote degree, tbh going colleges after graduation, the people and network from the college is as important as/ if not, more important that the actual course. If you take the equation of networking out of it, you're better off doing mooc courses which offer way more value and quality than general institutions.

[13/06/18, 7:08:14 PM] ‪+91 94948 58694‬: 👋Hello Pushstarters in Hyderabad!

This is Rajesh and I recently moved in to Hyderabad. I'm thinking to curate a list of *startup events happening in Hyderabad* and send it via WhatsApp broadcast messages.

It's my way of getting to know more startup folks in Hyderabad and more over it's an effort to deliver the *events happening in the coming weeks straight to your WhatsApp inbox.*

Is anyone here who wants to frequently participate in startup events, stay connected with the Hyderabad ecosystem and derive a huge value out of these events and the network you are going to build through these events in the coming days?

If you are a startup enthusiast in Hyderabad, please feel free to 📲 message me on *9494858694* saying *I'm interested*.

Thanks, looking forward to connecting with startup enthusiasts.

[14/06/18, 11:47:43 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Well, the point here is, the experiment asks you to post whatever relevant stuff in terms of publicity you "personally want" to post. So you can choose to cover what you feel is a potent threat to your IP.

[15/06/18, 12:39:38 AM] ‪+91 80089 74749‬: Is going for crowd funding at pre seed stage a good option, if so how does each party approach.
1)The entrepreneur who's rising fund
2) The individual contributing to the fund goal
I specifically want to understand which is best approach between debt based and equity based crowd funding
[15/06/18, 12:40:57 AM] ‪+91 80089 74749‬: And if crowd funding in India a tricky option what equity percentage is optimum to lose at pre seed stage
[15/06/18, 1:10:32 AM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Good question.
[15/06/18, 1:38:36 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Is Equity based crowdfunding actually legal in India?
[15/06/18, 1:38:57 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I don’t think so bro
[15/06/18, 1:39:02 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @918953881643 is it?
[15/06/18, 1:57:27 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): nope. Offerings are to be given
[15/06/18, 1:57:38 AM] Neeraj Joshi: wohi toh
[15/06/18, 1:57:41 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Equity based funding si similar to ICO and thus not allowed
[15/06/18, 1:58:07 AM] Neeraj Joshi: what is debt based crowd funding?
[15/06/18, 1:58:11 AM] Neeraj Joshi: WHUT?
[15/06/18, 1:59:08 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Equity crowdfunding is nothing but raising funds from individuals in return for an equity share in the company. In India, this is banned. In debt-based crowdfunding, investors get a degree of interest every month, rather than equity in the enterprise.
[15/06/18, 1:59:22 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): debt-based crowdfunding is also known as peer-to-peer lending or P2P.

With this type of crowdfunding, individuals lend money to businesses or other individuals with the expectation that it will be repaid together with interest added.

P2P lending platforms such as Funding Circle (lending to businesses) and Zopa (lending to individuals) enable lenders to earn better returns than they’d typically get from a standard bank or building society savings account.

[15/06/18, 2:03:00 AM] Neeraj Joshi: allowed in india bhai?
[15/06/18, 2:04:17 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): The short answer is that Equity crowdfunding is illegal while Reward-based and donor-based crowdfunding remain legal.
[15/06/18, 2:04:29 AM] Neeraj Joshi: debt based?

[15/06/18, 2:06:26 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): The Difference Between Equity-based Crowdfunding And Debt-based Crowdfunding--
Equity crowdfunding is nothing but raising funds from individuals in return for an equity share in the company. In India, this is banned. In debt-based crowdfunding, investors get a degree of interest every month, rather than equity in the enterprise.
[15/06/18, 2:07:35 AM] Neeraj Joshi: so that is allowed kya? the debt based one?
[15/06/18, 2:08:04 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Its a So-So. Under many rules it can be, but not easy
[15/06/18, 2:08:52 AM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): How do they ensure that the lender receives the money back?

[15/06/18, 2:46:53 AM] ‪+91 80089 74749‬: Enlightening discourse. What if the lending is put on blockchain where after a certain time you can sell your investment at a profit. The burden is shared between entrepreneur and the new investor buying in. Of course a set equity must be put in place so that funds keep flowing at the same time those investing are holding on till valuation of the product increases which is the premise of going for crowd funding.

[15/06/18, 10:15:49 AM] Neeraj Joshi: You can’t really trust a community until you meet the members offline

[16/06/18, 4:48:36 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Well. I do not even personally know him, but sometimes failures in fulfilling any commitments of any agreement due to immediate circumstances also looks like a fraudulent conduct to the world.
[16/06/18, 4:50:56 PM] Sayan Ganguly: So, unless the proof is concrete which proves that any non-committal was wilful, it is not always right to term someone fraudulent.
[16/06/18, 4:51:11 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): I agree here
[16/06/18, 4:51:58 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): Unless someone has a bonafide bad experience where this guy has cheated someone., I think we shouldn't malign him

[16/06/18, 5:25:06 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): It's just that many times people don't honour their own words. Their self-interest surpasses someone else's things or matters.

Like I almost lost 40k from a person and 15k each from 2 ppl, but I have recovered silently the 30k and may get ugly to recover 40k.

[16/06/18, 6:25:42 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): It is good to see both sides, but if things are harmful for you, better not be a scientist or researcher for the case in 1st place.

[20/06/18, 8:35:24 PM] Ibrahim (ps): Hi ruchika and anush. Welcome to the group 🙂🌹
[20/06/18, 8:35:55 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What is Pushstart? 
Pushstart is India’s most active community for entrepreneurs to Learn, Share knowledge and Grow.

You can share your idea, launch your startup and share your daily life startup problems to get community-sourced feedback, guidance and solutions. 

We have penetrated across 12+ cities with 60+ offline meetups and have a membership of 11k+ in a span of less than 11 months. 

Why Pushstart? 
Lack of exposure, knowledge and guidance at the initial stage of an entrepreneur’s journey. 
Lack of community of relevant like minded entrepreneurs where ideas, startup and problems can be discussed in a healthy and unbiased way.
Lack of peer to peer knowledge sharing among entrepreneurs.  
Lack of platform for successful entrepreneurs to share their experienced-based learnings and knowledge.  
Loneliness in entrepreneurship.

Our Values and Culture?
Pushstart is a family of entrepreneurs and all pushstarters are friends. 
We respect each other irrespective of profile, gender or age. 
We are known for constructive criticism and unbiased feedback. 
We don’t market ourselves or our products. We share our knowledge and build our personal brand. 
We believe in the culture of help and get helped. 

How it works? 
As soon as you join Pushstart, you unlock the following powers: 

Share your Idea, Startup and Problems:

[21/06/18, 11:39:44 AM] ‪+91 78726 83935‬: Hi, I'm Sumit Chaudhary, a graduate from IIT KHARAGPUR, currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft Hyderabad. I was a part of a edu-tech startup in college (we eventually shut down) and have a flair for entrepreneurship, mostly in the domains of technology, finance, content.
[21/06/18, 12:40:43 PM] Lokesh (pushstart): Hey, Sumit I am Lokesh currently in my 3rd year from BITS Goa. Need some advice regarding working on a startup during college life.
[21/06/18, 12:41:29 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): What's your cgpa?
[21/06/18, 12:43:19 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Welcome Sumit :)
[21/06/18, 1:07:13 PM] Lokesh (pushstart): Why 😂😂
[21/06/18, 1:10:38 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): If it's above 7.5 then risking its fall would be a bad idea. Companies may not look at it favorably, if one ends up looking for jobs.
[21/06/18, 1:12:21 PM] Lokesh (pushstart): Oh, you are suggesting that if it's low than risking is fine?
[21/06/18, 1:16:07 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): Yeah, less of a risk. The quantum of fall would be likely lesser. It's exponential effort to reward ratio either side for cgpa change.
[21/06/18, 1:16:35 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): At least used to be 20 years ago 😜😜
[21/06/18, 1:16:59 PM] Lokesh (pushstart): Right.

[21/06/18, 6:53:07 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): This is the 8th year of the Anjani Mashelkar Inclusive Innovation Award
that had been set up in the memory of R A Mashelkar's late mother, who always persuaded him to use science and technology for the benefit of the needy- especially the poor. They have had great winners in the previous years, more information is available at- https://lnkd.in/fcSDvDi

This award presents an opportunity to spur and fuel innovation for the benefit of the most disadvantaged sections of society in order to ‘include’ them into the mainstream. It also has another equally important aim: to sensitize innovators about the problems faced by such sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.

The awardees will preferably be those who believe in not just ‘best practices’, but ‘next practices’. Most importantly, it will value solutions that represent ‘affordable excellence’, breaking the myth that ‘affordability’ and ‘excellence’ cannot go together.
As the award grows in stature and gains national recognition, it will endeavour to leverage support for the innovator from various other private and public sector organizations.

Criteria-
Only Indian organizations or persons of Indian origin are eligible to apply.
Innovators of all ages may apply.
The nominations should be for prototypes or proof of concepts which have the potential to be successful innovations. Raw ideas will not be considered.
The prototypes, products, services or business models should be original and novel.
They should provide highest quality affordable products and experiences to the resource poor people.
The innovations should substantially and positively affect the quality of life of the disadvantaged sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.
All applications should clearly explain the innovation, the originality of the idea, its benefit, and impact.
[21/06/18, 9:46:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: #AMA33 is LIVE @ Pushstart by Nikhil Jain on 
“How to leverage LinkedIn for Personal and Business Growth”.

Well, Who doesn't like to be healthy and fit?💪 But it comes with the price and hard work.
We observed few problems like,
1. Overpriced personal trainers 💰
2. Underqualified gym trainer along with lack of attention 😞
3. The science behind a personalized meal or workout plan is not possible by an individual to knowledge and time constraints 🤯
4. Overwhelmed and confused with too many online videos/trainers/blogs etc 🤔
We would like to address this problem with help of the personal virtual assistant which is best at its job, cheaper and always with you to understand your needs 🤖

We would like you to spare few minutes to fill out the survey to understand your problems and adoption of virtual assistance for an ultimate long-term solution 😎

Thanks in advance. Your honest feedback is valuable to us.

Kindly spend 2 minutes of your valuable time and fill out the feedback.

[22/06/18, 9:33:54 AM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): Hi Yogesh, liked the idea and the presentation
[22/06/18, 9:36:17 AM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): However, be wary of the dynamics of different body types. You need to understand so many other things before suggesting a workout plan like their history with any injuries etc.,
Also, looks like you're only suggesting workout plans for someone going to Gym. For females and even for some working professionals, they prefer home based workouts. You can focus on that too.
[22/06/18, 9:37:55 AM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): What about help with diet plans? Have a look at Goqii coaches and the way they interact all the time. They're good.
[22/06/18, 10:08:35 AM] Subhi Saxena (ps): Hi Yogesh, I know many friends who find workouts to be boring or monotonous, especially after having visited the gym for a month or two. Such people might love playing sports/dance/trek/etc. Some of them prefer community workouts to reduce the monotony. You can include these aspects into your product. Basically making working out more of a fun activity and less of a monotonous task/job
[22/06/18, 10:37:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters from Hyd,

[22/06/18, 12:36:42 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Yes I agree with you. Since every individual is different and hence need to design and train differently. That's the biggest challenge to solve. And we are on it 😊
I kept demo showing only weight training and the problem I saw while doing same. I have to understand the pain point people face while doing workout at home. That's why this validation. I am curious to know what all pain point everyone face while doing any sort of workout. I assume point 3 and 4 would be common for any kinda workout. Would love to know your feedback 😊

If anyone had complaints with LinkedIn App or Desktop version and had not got them resolved.

I guess this can be an opportunity for you to bring those issues or errors.

The Head of Engineering of LinkedIn and the VP of products of LinkedIn are taking a look at many of the errors flagged by me through this LinkedIn post.


PS- One can choose to omit as its for those who were facing errors with LinkedIn and wish to improve it.
[24/06/18, 11:38:08 PM] Vrushal Kadnapis (pushstart): Hey Hyderabad Pushstarters

So many people use it passively withou participating.

[30/06/18, 9:51:54 AM] Neeraj Joshi: [Long Read] - Invite for Social Samosa's LIVE Conference

The team at Social Samosa is excited to pay a tribute to the medium which is a driving factor for the evolution, existence and sustenance of quite a lot of Brands, Agencies, Publishers, Platforms, and Creators!

When we set out to recreate the #SMLive Magic this year, I was told 8 Million People and 2 Lac+ Video Views were possible in 2017 and it's a tough nut to crack considering the friendly NewsFeed algorithm.

As ambitious as it may sound, riding high in the faith and power of our community of Marketers, Agency Professionals, Creators, and Practitioner we are all set to take the challenge and breach the circles of virality with #SMLive2018

We plan to kick-start the day with a Keynote Address from one of the pioneers in Indian Advertising and Marketing Industry - Mr. Ashish Bhasin

Taking the baton from him C-Suite Advisor and Power Influencer - Tanvi Gautam will take us through the essentials of Building an Authentic Personal Brand on Social Media

Anoushka Adya, Rashi Ray and Mounica Tata DoodleODrama will discuss on how Social Media has emerged as a great tool to enable Women Empowerment

This is just the beginning; next up we have Kainaz Karmakar  and Harshad Rajadhyaksha from the team which managed to win Ogilvy India's first CANNES Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness this year with Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks. They will speak about the LITTLE they know about Great Advertising!

A lot has been spoken about the various applications of Data across, Ashish Tiwari will share a different perspective on Data-Driven Storytelling to craft the right message

Chandramohan Mehra from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will bring in the flavor of Hyper Current and Topical Content with anecdotes from their collaboration with Dabbu The Dancer aka The Dancing Uncle

Threading thoughts from being responsive and customer-centric at all points in time, Vineet Singh will share Quick Social CRM Hacks to win over audiences

Mr. Bean from the Indian Digital Industry, Nitin Bhatia will enunciate the importance and relevance of Data in the value chain

Shifting Gear towards some Creator Tales, Ranveer Allahbadia - The Beer Biceps will share his story on carving a niche amongst the content clutter

The Master Storyteller behind some of the most engaging original content from Kingfisher, Sandeep Balan will draw parallels between Branded Content and Original Content

Over the past few years, Wittyfeed has become one of the largest Viral Content Companies and Parveen Singhal will share Growth Hacking Lessons in the process of building this new age company

Nidhi Bisht and Sarjita Jain from India's Leading Women Content Channel will sum up the #SMLive2018 show with a talk on Creating Entertainment for Women with Brands

That's the amazing lineup we have been talking about ever since we launched the initiative this year; as we strive to raise the bar and make this BIGGER & BETTER we are counting on your support to make this happen!

Come and join us to Celebrate #WorldSocialMedia Day

- Show Interest/Attendance to the event here bit.ly/SMLive2018

- Engage with our esteemed speakers who are sparing out time on a Saturday for this cause

- Share your favorite sessions within the network and shower some love using #SMLive2018

[10/07/18, 7:57:45 AM] ‪+91 93463 29346‬: I mean there are already waay too many consultants for doing this. Princeton boasts the same, a few other like admissiom ado also try to rope in alumni to help people out. Afaik.

[10/07/18, 7:58:59 AM] ‪+91 93463 29346‬: Plus you can use the same core idea but maybe do things differently. So it really depends on what's new that you are bringing to the table.

[20/07/18, 11:23:30 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Also. This brings us to a question important to many here: what were the parameters used for vetting
[20/07/18, 11:22:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Can't really disclose all the parameters used. But referral from a trusted person had a heavy weightage while vetting ❤ ❤
[20/07/18, 11:23:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you guys have any questions or suggestions regarding it, feel free to convey it here. We will be implementing these from tomorrow :)

[26/07/18, 10:52:05 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Gloria is taking last few questions
[27/07/18, 12:02:53 AM] Ibrahim (ps): Is there any answer as to why we get such a nice sleep while studying for the exams!!
[27/07/18, 12:04:37 AM] Ibrahim (ps): It feels like the best time of the year jab itne special neend aati hai!
[27/07/18, 12:05:54 AM] ‪+91 80193 45912‬: You cannot meet energy demands made by your brain hence you feel tired and sleep 😴
[27/07/18, 12:05:54 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): lol
[27/07/18, 12:09:30 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Ask it on fb
[27/07/18, 12:10:07 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): thats one thing
[27/07/18, 12:10:31 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): also anxiety of exams make your body produce endomorphines, so it gets you high and sleepy
[27/07/18, 12:12:22 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha...because u aren’t motivated enough to give exams 😆
[27/07/18, 12:13:21 AM] Revanth (pushstart): what would you have done in that particular period of time, if not studying for exams?
sleep? play? watch something that you like?
try to do something that interests you and i don't think you'll feel sleepy anymore unless your brain really needs it
[27/07/18, 12:13:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Perfect answer
[27/07/18, 12:14:16 AM] Revanth (pushstart): may be you're studying for the sake of exams rather than to learn an interesting concept
[27/07/18, 12:14:28 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): better get high and consume caffine, the combo is amazing to do hyper work
[27/07/18, 12:58:33 PM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): Main: Computer Science + Javascript... Optional: React/NodeJS.

AMA: All of us have constant questions about the deep (dark?) world of VC funding or investments in general across different levels (Seed to Growth). 

Today, as discussed with Neeraj Joshi, I am doing an AMA to answer any of your queries in and around this topic. 

About me: I have been a global investor and a serial entrepreneur, with multiple successful exits and investments across countries, using my roles as founder of a VC firm while being Advisor to a number of others. 

I take pride in building multi-million dollar companies, Great Manager Institute being the recent one. I run quite a few companies in different geographies. 

I am NOT an expert. I am just a learner and a perennial student.

[14/08/18, 8:54:37 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Hey @919502444362, welcome to the community and please introduce yourself.
[14/08/18, 9:43:29 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Thanks Yogesh. Hi guys, this is VS Pavan, I'm an innovator, & starting my own company now. It's called SQUPUS (SQUirrel + octoPUS). Through that we gonna launch our first product called NANOS this 24.
‎[14/08/18, 9:43:36 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: ‎image omitted
[14/08/18, 9:43:54 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: NANOS is an environment where we can build our products/services without programming knowledge. NANOS will be made of small atomic components with reason-action pairs called NANO SERVICES, which are just like neurons in our brain. These nano services could be mapped together to build NEURAL map, which controls the flow of the application. With this technology, apps we build are super fast, robust, light weight, & smart.

[15/08/18, 4:00:41 PM] Ibrahim (ps): Why people prefer becoming an entrepreneur and yet want people to join their company as an employee. 

If everyone becomes an entrepreneur will there be a decline in employees?
[15/08/18, 4:17:35 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Nope. have you every compared India's pop to number of sustainable startups?
[15/08/18, 4:18:50 PM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): Becoming an entrepreneur is a personal choice and doesn't need to arise from the feeling of hating to work for someone,always. So there's nothing wrong being an employee.

If more entrepreneurs, more jobs. The high number of unemployed becomes employable now.

[15/08/18, 5:22:20 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Welcome Shiv & Vaishnavi. It's nice to see people from different domains teaming up, let's share our knowledge irrespective of domains such that it could be helpful for us somewhere in our entrepreneurial journey. What say guys?
[15/08/18, 5:22:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Obviously bro ❤️❤️
[15/08/18, 5:25:28 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Let's just start understand what everyone of us trying to do. Let's reintroduce ourselves in terms of passion & dream rather than name & profession. This way we can either get or be extra pair of hands.
[15/08/18, 5:27:05 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Well said Bro, It’s all about connecting the dots.
[15/08/18, 5:28:33 PM] ‪+91 94936 70555‬: We are working out on AI based solution in healthcare domain. We aren’t public yet, ones we are ready with the prototype we are planning to present that in out next Meetup.
[15/08/18, 5:28:39 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Exactly. N moreover the group will have something to be active rather than just saying about us all the time. Let's make this a learning experience.
[15/08/18, 5:29:12 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: What sort of AI, like any usecase where it could be implemented?
[15/08/18, 5:29:13 PM] ‪+91 94741 88603‬: Sure 😀
[15/08/18, 5:29:23 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: @918779219493 any idea when our next meetup would be?
[15/08/18, 5:30:35 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Yeah!
[15/08/18, 5:43:01 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: I did a similar project this year. We made a drone that flies around our university campus. It tags every plant on a virtual map using AI.
So we know which area of campus has which species of plants
[15/08/18, 5:47:11 PM] ‪+91 94741 88603‬: The project idea seems intriguing but what’s the purpose of it ..?
[15/08/18, 5:47:51 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: On a large scale it helps botanists find medicinal plants around the globe
[15/08/18, 5:48:48 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Where did find the data to train the model?
[15/08/18, 5:49:15 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Also how accurate was your solution?
[15/08/18, 5:49:18 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: There are lots of plant data sets
[15/08/18, 5:49:33 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: And we manually tagged few plants of our campus too
[15/08/18, 5:49:50 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: 25 - 35 %
[15/08/18, 5:50:24 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: I agree but you would be needing areal view for better accuracy I suppose?
[15/08/18, 5:50:38 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Did you find the specific public dataset?
[15/08/18, 5:51:12 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Actually it was not completely aerial. We drove our drone quite close to the plants
[15/08/18, 5:52:02 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: It was manual driven drone. So we drove it close enough and long enough until the plant is tagged
[15/08/18, 5:52:21 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: It can better, a random guess would have more probability isn’t it?
[15/08/18, 5:52:52 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: True. But with better data sets we can achieve upto 80% accuracy
[15/08/18, 5:53:06 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Great! 🙂
[15/08/18, 5:54:03 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Whenever we tagged a plant manually... On the next appearance of that plant, the drone was able to tag successfully
[15/08/18, 5:54:11 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: New plants is a real problem
[15/08/18, 5:55:25 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: This is the actual situation we would normally have.
[15/08/18, 5:55:35 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Yeahhh
[15/08/18, 5:55:47 PM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: But we can make it better I guess
[15/08/18, 5:55:57 PM] ‪+91 94744 55033‬: Sure you can.

[15/08/18, 6:55:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi All! Posting on behalf of The Goa Project (TGP).

The Goa Project is an annual “unconference” that brings together a diverse set of people from various fields – to converse, collaborate and co-create. The entire agenda is crowdsourced, leading to two exciting days of talks, workshops, presentations, pitches and interventions. Run completely by volunteers who are passionate about cross-sector learning, collaboration and ideas.

The sixth edition of TGP will happen on the 26-27th of Oct at a secret location that's NOT Goa! Yes you heard that right. We're also launching a week long (19-25th Oct, 2018) fully-funded TGP Residency where business owners, makers, thinkers, do-ers will be matched with inter-disciplinary collaborators bringing in an opportunity for both venture owners & collaborators to work on innovative solutions! 

This is where you come in! TGP is looking to reach out to exceptional venture-owners who will bring interesting flavors to the residency (they're also looking to find equally interesting collaborators, but more on that on a later date) and for this, included below are the application and more information links. We urge you to apply right away (deadline is 18th Aug), if you know someone who could benefit from this too, do spread the word to them as well!

Application link:  https://goo.gl/forms/ebqciZ1NTJf3oasZ2
More details on the residency: http://www.thegoaproject.com/eligibility-criteria/ 
FAQs: http://www.thegoaproject.com/faqs/ 

If you think you'd make an awesome volunteer instead, apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/ZpBmUvsQYv4IGQ8F2 

Appreciate the help!
Thanks!

You got ready, went to kitchen, found there are no eggs, create a nano service ([{{egg_count_in_home}} equals 0],[order_eggs_from_store]) which orders eggs from the store whenever there are no eggs. You got a notification from NANOS that "It's raining outside, you've plan to go out today, & you don't have umbrella or raincoat, I can either *order an umbrella* or *order a raincoat* or *book a cab* or *postpone the plan* or *inform you when the rain gets stopped*. What do you want me to do?" You just clicked book a cab. Now, on the dashboard you could see the money your nano services made for you, when you're away, & other stats. This ain't it, lot more we could imagine our future with *NANOS*, stay tuned. Block the date 24 Aug, join us to experience *NANOS*.

Thanks for taking the time to go over my CV. We have just recently spoken over LinkedIn. You can forward the following to interested people:

I looking for fulltime positions only. My current CTC is 17 lakh + commissions + benefits. My expected CTC is 25 lakh + commissions.


As discussed, I am an American expat looking for a job.  I have spent the last 8 years in India. I have worked in Sales & Marketing areas. I am looking for an opportunity where my American origin and Indian culture exposure can be leveraged, to minimize communication gap between international clients for Indian companies.



I have experience in the software services industry, and have worked as a cofounder of a bootstrapped startup. I am best suited for a software services or software product company with overseas clients. This can be either in Sales, Business Requirement analysis, or Product Management.



Please let me know if you come across any such opportunities. My number is 7722086168, what's a good day and time to chat to discuss this in more detail?



Best,

Yan

[18/08/18, 8:14:13 PM] Sankeerth (pushstart): No ,i mean lets take bangalore for instance most startups/people located around koramangala ,jp nagar nearby ,but in case of hyd people liv in many areas from banjara jubli hills to madhapur,so i guess its mostly location problem than any other
[18/08/18, 8:14:18 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Just wanted to know. Is Startup Beer which used to happen in Inorbit mall ka beerhouse still alive?

[18/08/18, 8:18:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Off topic hai. First let us understand the problem here

[18/08/18, 8:20:28 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): Connectivity wise, nothing beats zoom. If you have a bigger group, then you need a different camera and mic.
[18/08/18, 8:20:29 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Have location wise meetups
[18/08/18, 8:20:48 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): @919396414241 sirji

[18/08/18, 8:31:02 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Start with a party. Revive that Startup Beer. Also bring some influencers. People from ECIL had turned up for the first meeting. 
Also, keep an all-Hyd meeting a monthly affair. 
Let locality wise people meet weekly. 
At least people will come for some memorable time. Might work.
[18/08/18, 8:31:44 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Work on a plan and invite Ramesh Loganathan Garu at least. He will help you a lot.
[18/08/18, 8:38:51 PM] ‪+91 86397 35001‬: Sure thing...

[18/08/18, 8:44:03 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): That's logistics issue. First question is. Peeps willing to join?

[23/08/18, 4:45:49 PM] Ibrahim (ps): There are several apps and websites (like khan academy, byju's, toppr etc) that offer online tutorial packages to the students in several courses.

How do they tackle this situation in which one student buy the package and several students study from that just one package. 

Isn't that a loss for the company? How is this tackled?

[23/08/18, 5:22:46 PM] Ibrahim (ps): Any idea or suggestions to tackle this?
[23/08/18, 5:24:05 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: web camera based people counting ?
[23/08/18, 5:25:01 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: You can have the webcamera take a picture once in a while and then use open source CV frameworks like OpenCV to count the number of faces/people in the frame
[23/08/18, 5:25:38 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: you can also do a gaze detection later to check if those people are actually looking at the screen and not just standing around
[23/08/18, 5:27:07 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: You can also have a rule that says if within a span of 3 screenshots, if the same people are detected  ( >1 ) then send a warning to the user or so
[23/08/18, 5:27:26 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: for the last part you'll have to use face comparison
[23/08/18, 5:27:46 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: where you store the faces from the first screenshot and then compare them against successive screenshots
[23/08/18, 5:29:21 PM] Ibrahim (ps): Is this technique used by any company?
[23/08/18, 5:29:59 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: not sure
[23/08/18, 5:30:24 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: but the other alternative might be just allowing a limited number of active sessions per person
[23/08/18, 5:31:17 PM] Ibrahim (ps): Yeah true!
[23/08/18, 5:31:35 PM] Ibrahim (ps): I guess they make money through live classes!
[23/08/18, 5:32:12 PM] ‪+91 98683 98786‬: and byju through their tablets :D
[23/08/18, 5:38:14 PM] ‪+91 98207 16579‬: I think they simply accept the fact and price in the risk by setting a maximum limit on the no of screens that can access the account at any given point of time ( think Netflix)
[23/08/18, 5:38:27 PM] ‪+91 98207 16579‬: This in fact becomes a usp for them
[23/08/18, 5:53:38 PM] Ibrahim (ps): Even Google sends a mail if we login through a new ip
[23/08/18, 6:21:58 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): No fool-proof way to stop really.

Only way is one-attempt-only assessments plus results that can be used to deter them

[23/08/18, 7:03:19 PM] ‪+91 84668 91519‬: Exactly.Host id is linked to that.So it can be prevented to some extent.
[23/08/18, 7:05:56 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): Don't get it.

In my understanding the challenge was to avoid two people sharing a learning aide, making it very personalized is one way I suggested.

Can't limit content, only way to limit is how one can assess themselves.

[05/10/18, 10:14:46 PM] Sayan Ganguly: People.  With all due respect, let's not make fun of it
[05/10/18, 10:15:13 PM] Sayan Ganguly: They are trying to do something not so popular
[05/10/18, 10:16:20 PM] Sayan Ganguly: But. I have a doubt
[05/10/18, 10:16:29 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Why a dietician?
[05/10/18, 10:16:38 PM] Sayan Ganguly: A chef can do it right?
[05/10/18, 10:17:02 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Well. Of course, the ingredients come under the guidance of a dietician
[05/10/18, 10:17:29 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Alright.
[05/10/18, 10:17:48 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Try Apollo health studio
[05/10/18, 10:18:37 PM] Sayan Ganguly: It's not very far from 91sb
[05/10/18, 10:18:59 PM] Sayan Ganguly: It's near the Best Western hotel near Madhapur
[05/10/18, 10:19:25 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Direct approach is always better
[06/10/18, 10:03:25 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Yes, along with dietitian will educate about nutritional importance of ingredients. Also how to make it colourful.
[06/10/18, 10:04:16 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Weirdo
[06/10/18, 10:04:26 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): you need a chef not a dietician
[06/10/18, 10:05:12 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Haha, not that difficult job bro. Dietician is easy and cheaper to find I think.
[06/10/18, 10:05:58 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): na chef is cheaper, might even get a restaurant/cafe to partner and sponsor
[06/10/18, 10:06:28 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): its about making a amazing salad !
[06/10/18, 10:07:20 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): *an
[06/10/18, 10:19:28 AM] Sayan Ganguly: A health one too I presume?
[06/10/18, 10:19:37 AM] Sayan Ganguly: Healthy *
[06/10/18, 10:27:32 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Salad is healthy only 🤔
[06/10/18, 10:28:32 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Nice suggestion, can try. Advantage with dietitian is he/she can pitch about their service.
[06/10/18, 10:28:58 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): all salads are healthy
[06/10/18, 10:29:40 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): dietitian can but then most cant toss and place a salad well, plus variety of salads can be made by a chef
[06/10/18, 10:30:03 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Pm? Pe kar lo bhailog
[06/10/18, 10:30:13 AM] Ravi Kaddy (pushstart): Hi Yogesh I am having 300 gyms data base of Hyderabad with trainers number ....which I collected from my executives during marketing of one product......plz let me know ifit helps you
[06/10/18, 10:30:27 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 🙌🏻🙌🏻
[06/10/18, 10:30:54 AM] Ravi Kaddy (pushstart): Thank you sirji
[06/10/18, 10:31:07 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): BTW, chef or dietician. This will depend on what the end goal is.

Tasty salads, then Chefs are the go

Only salads, then dietician is required as he could only explain the nutrients
[06/10/18, 10:31:18 AM] Ravi Kaddy (pushstart): Plz share mail id
[06/10/18, 10:32:12 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): actually most chefs are trained to explain and understand how the nutrients work
[06/10/18, 10:32:51 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): The amount of change in antioxidants and other micro nutrients are not their forte sir
[06/10/18, 10:34:29 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): good chefs have a course on that as well, i interact with a lot of chefs on a regular basis, they are not as proficient as a dieticians but then they know the shit
[06/10/18, 10:34:56 AM] Sayan Ganguly: Oil?
[06/10/18, 10:35:15 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): evoo ! super healthy oil
[06/10/18, 10:35:22 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): 100% virgin olive for dressing the salads
[06/10/18, 10:35:42 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): *evoo = extra virgin olive oil
[06/10/18, 10:37:50 AM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Waaah!

[06/10/18, 11:02:08 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): exactly !
[06/10/18, 11:07:46 AM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Actually it's not true that chefs knows about the nutritional values of the food they make. I myself own restaurants and I am aware of my chefs. They all worked previously in reputed hotels like taj mumbai.

A dietician is smarter choice.
[06/10/18, 11:10:09 AM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Find a dietician who is a mom too. I'm sure she makes salads tasty for her kids.
[06/10/18, 11:10:34 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): hmm interesting approach !
[06/10/18, 11:11:00 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i would ideally go for a combo, but if you want it to be attractive, a goof chef is the way to go
[06/10/18, 11:11:27 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Yeah. Perfect. But difficult I guess. To do let me know if there is any place to look. Urbanclap and all is not helpful
[06/10/18, 11:11:33 AM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Yeah. Presentation can be only be done by professional chefs
[06/10/18, 11:11:49 AM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): find a mommy blogger !
[06/10/18, 11:11:59 AM] ‪+91 70324 84884‬: Bingo !!!

How is it different from the traditional fingerprint scanners that we find outside building for security ?

I’m gonna tell you the easiest way to earn *passive income* of 50k- 1 lac per month .  (Working process , No scam etc) 

people want to open food business but don’t have time/energy/money  to open or maintain it. 


We at MemeCycles, bringing a unique food cycle for the first time in India. 

*We basically provide everything to setup a food cycle* including free meme cycle, kitchen machinary, Free legal licenses, continuous supply of raw materials.  And the best,
*No rent. You may put it in any public place*

All you have to do is hire chefs and collect the money everyday.

[07/10/18, 4:16:43 PM] Rupesh Garg (ps): yes that also I want to know about
[07/10/18, 4:18:24 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): It depends on the state you are. In Telangana, For engine vehicles such as Food trucks, you need permission from GHMC. 

Since our MemeCycle is engineless and movable we can put in any public places


 (Some exceptions like Raheja Mindspace in Hyderabad. - They have a good union. They won’t allow any outsiders to open a food business)
[07/10/18, 4:18:35 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Food union *
[07/10/18, 4:19:47 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Right now, we started our trial in 2 places. 

Dilsukhnagar and Singapore township. 


Average counter everyday would be around 6-7k
[07/10/18, 4:21:07 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Franchise. For setting up the whole business for you. 


Right now, we sold 2 franchises in Hyderabad. 

We are offering 20% discount to first 5 franchises 😀
[07/10/18, 4:22:35 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): As long as you open the food cycle until, 11PM you don’t need any permission. 

They ask for food license which will be included in licence
[07/10/18, 4:22:52 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): *6-7k without Swiggy/Zomato*
[07/10/18, 4:23:47 PM] Jeet (pushstart): How much manpower required for one cycle?
What are other costs of operations?

[07/10/18, 4:42:42 PM] Neeraj Joshi: @919960058547 bro check this
[07/10/18, 4:45:27 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): That’s a good question. 

Quality is maintained by —- 

- We provide all the food ingredients /Raw materials. 

- We provide training for the chef (Especially because we are bringing this new item called - MEME-Baz) for first time to Hyderabadis. 


Even though if Franchises continues to provide poor quality,  we have to take necessary steps as per the franchise agreement. 


USP: As mentioned above.
[07/10/18, 4:47:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 50k-1l bottom line or top line?
[07/10/18, 4:47:27 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Right now, in Hyderabad. 

*Basically , now we won’t be getting any profit by selling it for 4L*  😅

There’s some really good business model ahead :)
[07/10/18, 4:48:39 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Hahahah. Neeraj way 😛

[07/10/18, 4:50:49 PM] Rohan Shah(ps): What about the consistency in earning profits for the franchisee ?

What about the sustainability for the franchisee owners ?
[07/10/18, 4:51:23 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Rohit, I can tell you that in future, your profit depends on online delivery. 

MemeCycle will be only one per city. 

If you establish yourself early, chances are, you will be getting more online deliveries :)
[07/10/18, 4:51:28 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Would want to know this as well.
[07/10/18, 4:51:47 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): I didn't get this

[07/10/18, 4:53:33 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Depends on area you’re opening. 

You can hit 1L + if you are lucky enough to put near any IT Office’s 😛
[07/10/18, 4:54:17 PM] Neeraj Joshi: [4:12 PM, 10/7/2018] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): So you’re reading this. Okay!

 It is indeed tempting to invest 5 lakhs thinking about the profit you assure but can we really manage without being at location?

[07/10/18, 5:17:54 PM] ‪+91 99493 79073‬: @918284092169  just another question.

Do you have money back guarantee or buy back policy or at least take responsibility to transfer the franchise to another clients?
[07/10/18, 5:18:37 PM] Rupesh Garg (ps): yes I also have the same question
[07/10/18, 5:19:42 PM] ‪+91 99493 79073‬: Because we put in hard earned money to earn something out of it.
[07/10/18, 5:20:13 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Yes. 

I left my job for this startup 😅
[07/10/18, 5:20:51 PM] ‪+91 83741 68954‬: Aaj aapka Company corn se unicorn banega
[07/10/18, 5:24:59 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Mane ?
[07/10/18, 5:25:29 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): Money back guarantee — 

Practically speaking, that we can’t do because we are already buying all the stuff for you in the first place. 


Transfer Franchise — That can be done if the new client agrees for the discounted price. 


PS: Don’t worry mate. We are just starting. We try nothing less than perfectness to keep you in profits. 

At worst, you can sell all these stuff on OLX n you’ll get atleast 2.5L to 3L 😅
[07/10/18, 5:29:07 PM] ‪+91 83741 68954‬: It will be appealing to the highest bidder ,unicorn is a billion dollar funded company by investment input and valuation
[07/10/18, 5:29:54 PM] ‪+91 83741 68954‬: Out here my unicorn context was with reference to the acquisition buzz on the start up
[07/10/18, 5:34:36 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Oh nice to know.
[07/10/18, 5:35:10 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Intresting :). I am currently looking to grow some Intresting corn seeds and stuff
[07/10/18, 5:35:57 PM] Jeet (pushstart): I thought you quit the corn business.
[07/10/18, 5:38:07 PM] ‪+91 99493 79073‬: @918284092169 another question

To better understand the profits in layman language, I need to know if on an average we make 5000₹ a day which means 150000₹ a month then what would be my raw material cost in it including gas and other disposables?
[07/10/18, 5:40:54 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Nope our operations are being restructured, our clients defaulted. So we choose to rework our logistical side. 

I still supply raw corn and seeds. Have an active intrest in growing an Indian vareity, with High yeild and also some nice natural colours.

Its a farm to fork operation. The reatil is being restructured. :)

[07/10/18, 5:45:14 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): As you said, Worst case: You earn 5000₹ per day including online delivery 

1.5L per month. 
**********
Costs:

30k - salaries 
30k - chicken (Shawarma)
15k - Gas
5k- Plastic materials (Tissues, plates etc) 
6k- Maggie packets

Profit: 48k per month
[07/10/18, 5:46:58 PM] Hardha Reddy (pushstart): I see most of the IT employees think food businesses more than our salaries. 

But they just don’t do it because of dignity in society. 

We wanna solve it.
[07/10/18, 5:52:28 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): That's an interesting premise even for bankers and a lot of corporate employees.

[01/11/18, 2:59:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi Pushstarters, congratulations on building together a thriving startup community in India. I have been a part of Pushstart for quite some time now and have seen numerous launches of some great products and have scooped brains behind those products. 

I am a product marketing manager for a small but fast growing B2E business. We have a product that we have been using internally for sometime now to streamline the devops process within the organisation and it has been quite fruitful for us. We plan to launch it for other people in the community to get them started with devops quickly and intuitively. But for that I need some feedback from you guys.

Just some questions to understand your team’s pain points and overall outlook at the devops process within your organisation.

If you build, manage and deploy release pipelines within your organisation, or anything remotely associated with devops. I would love to hear you out and ask you a few questions.

Here’s the link to reach me out on Whatsapp: http://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=918527464661

[06/11/18, 4:09:58 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: *Tell me why should I pay attention to NANOS?* Someone asked me this.

All you need to learn is to
1. Build a nano service.
2. Map nano services.

With that negligible learning curve, you could build your virtual brain which could receive your call/message before you does, and could ignore the things you're not interested, and update you with something useful, without you really has to look at it or attend it.

Your intelligence could be a developer to build something for your client without YOU to sit n code.

If your client asks your virtual brain to design something, it uses your intelligence, and create real design stuff.

Yeah, you could also do these things right?

But NANOS builds instances of you, to handle multiple things from different people at the same time. Technically, you could serve infinite clients, talk to infinite people, and do infinite tasks at the same time, without YOU actually doing it manually.

Ok, what I'm saying is so futuristic, what're the basic things it could do for you?

Applying for job, search content, and many more.

So now, if you feel this interesting, join me tomorrow in exploring NANOS at 7pm IST.

[08/11/18, 2:43:42 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: *BUILDING VIRTUAL BRAINS TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY*

We, as people have certain abilities that differentiate us from machines. But we spend most of time doing the same things/applying same intelligence to get the tasks done. This is leaving us with less time to learn and evolve. NANOS helps you here. It is a virtual human brain technology which builds the virtual self of us with our intelligence. This will enable us to handle innumerous clients at the same time, without our presence or with least presence. This will drastically increasing productivity, leaving us to explore the things and enjoy life.

Just imagine where you're in a party, and boss needs some work to be done. He could give it to your virtual brain, it does it. What if you're reading a book, and one of your instance of you is talking to your client, other is developing a software, other is drawing something, and other is emailing your boss? Cool right?

This is what NANOS is built for, it could create the virtual YOU/YOUR EMPLOYEES, increase the productivity, gives you time for real stuff.

Awaiting your response.


Thanks & regards,
VS Pavan,
Founder & Innovator,
NANOS

[14/11/18, 12:44:16 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): awesome, did not know we had a THub employee here.
[14/11/18, 12:44:56 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): can we have a directory, maybe an excel sheet of all the group members, their contact details and company name etc, shared on this group, so that it forms part of the group media & is accessible to all?
[14/11/18, 12:45:46 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): i mean this *PushStart* group.
[14/11/18, 12:46:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: No sorry! Can't share the DB with anyone
[14/11/18, 12:47:12 PM] Neeraj Joshi: You can ask whenever you want to ask for help here. We as Admin team will connect
[14/11/18, 12:49:31 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): ?? why not ??
as it is almost everyone's name and mobile number is visible on the group info. 
all that is needed is company name, which makes asking for things & help easier. 
sometimes you dont even know that what you need is available in the group.
[14/11/18, 12:51:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Thats why you are free to ask for anything on the group sir
[14/11/18, 12:52:05 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): also, it makes targetted networking easier, if you know the constituent members of the group.
[14/11/18, 12:52:48 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): agreed boss, but all of us are part of so many groups, it makes sense to have info on hand rather than asking and waiting
[14/11/18, 12:52:50 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): infacts,
[14/11/18, 12:53:13 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Might be the feature when we start with paid subscription for the group
[14/11/18, 12:53:20 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Can't offer everything for free
[14/11/18, 12:53:33 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): most the business groups I am part of have such docs in the group, so that people can reach out to whomever they want.
[14/11/18, 12:54:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: its like giving our members private info to the public
[14/11/18, 12:54:45 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): haha, c'mon..... it is not as if group members are going to sell that info to anyone.
[14/11/18, 12:55:02 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): if that is the quality of members, they would not have been in the group, right??
[14/11/18, 12:55:26 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): you have vetted and checked who is entering the group, no?
[14/11/18, 12:55:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: can u name the groups which does this?
[14/11/18, 12:56:57 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): there are 14 groups Neeraj, 
for ex: I am part of an India wide Events suppliers group, 
we have an entire excel sheet of member (in that whatsapp group) names, numbers, email & company name, plus their core competencies listed.
[14/11/18, 12:57:19 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): this makes it easier to reach out and network for specific things.
[14/11/18, 12:57:58 PM] Neeraj Joshi: got it. Let me get back to you on why we don't prefer sharing the DB wait
[14/11/18, 12:58:12 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): sure please do,
[14/11/18, 12:58:23 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): woul love to hear this,
[14/11/18, 1:00:34 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): lemme give you another incident Neeraj
[14/11/18, 1:00:41 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): One point is engagement sir..:).

If you give me the list today, why would I be active here?
[14/11/18, 1:00:51 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): I would just open the Excel and take the connection out
[14/11/18, 1:00:58 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Connect and BOOM!
[14/11/18, 1:01:04 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): naah, not a valid reason, lemme tell you why
[14/11/18, 1:01:08 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): We are no data vendors..:)
[14/11/18, 1:01:14 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): I'm all ears
[14/11/18, 1:01:20 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): vendors means selling,

[14/11/18, 1:01:42 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): You invest your time
[14/11/18, 1:01:46 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): We provide you value
[14/11/18, 1:01:49 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): are you planning to selling that data
[14/11/18, 1:02:00 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): ...:)
[14/11/18, 1:02:05 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): ..:)
[14/11/18, 1:02:23 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): It's a community sir. If we directly give the contacts, WhatsApp groups are of no use
[14/11/18, 1:02:34 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): This is interesting
[14/11/18, 1:02:37 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Imagine yourself waking up everyday and seeing contacts updated in the Excel sheet
[14/11/18, 1:02:48 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Would you come to this platform to seek connection?
[14/11/18, 1:02:53 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): I'm afraid not..:)
[14/11/18, 1:04:19 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): +1
[14/11/18, 1:04:37 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): ok I dont want to get into this argument game, 
for every comment of yours I can give a rejoinder. 
this is a suggestion which works in many groups, hence I floated the suggestion, 

group is yours , you are admins, do as you please. 

seems you want to shoot down suggestions without getting into discussions about it.
[14/11/18, 1:04:37 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): It removes the speciality that Pushstart provides from the beginning.
[14/11/18, 1:04:39 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): thanks,
[14/11/18, 1:05:33 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): yes I would, it is not only contacts, 
there are so many things else one asks for.
[14/11/18, 1:05:51 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): We are all open for suggestions sir but yes, we do question.
I'll be happy to listen to your answers and implement your suggestions post that.
[14/11/18, 1:06:05 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): +1
[14/11/18, 1:06:14 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): No dear. No one wants to shoot/shut down suggestions. 

What you did first was a suggestion. The statements that followed it after providing valuable reasons weren't suggestions/discussions at all. They were forced down points forcing us to share. 

I am an early member of Pushstart and know how it evolved to what it is now.
[14/11/18, 1:06:20 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): have already given answers to the why
[14/11/18, 1:07:09 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Providing contact details openly shuts down communication of a community and it diverts to a personal one on one approach removing and crossing the community in the process.
[14/11/18, 1:07:32 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): If admins, see if there is something that can be answered by an expert Pushstarter, we always connect/tag them.
[14/11/18, 1:07:38 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): That's why the admins are there.
[14/11/18, 1:07:38 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): dearie, 

I am not giving 'forced down points" - to set the record straight. 

I gave you inputs on what happens in other groups, and how it helps members. you call THAT "forcing" ? really?
[14/11/18, 1:08:06 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): +1
[14/11/18, 1:08:53 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): as I said, that was a suggestion, 

take it or leave it, 

totally your discretion and call.
[14/11/18, 1:08:58 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Yes. The language might have been more subtle and suggestive instead of validly defending your statements. When you defend, others will always be prompted to attack. Take away your shield so that we can take away our swords and spears. Come to dialogues openly and we can discuss it over a beer/cofee
[14/11/18, 1:09:40 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): We understand your point sir. It's just that our group operates this way using this hypothesis.
Anyway, we'll definitely consider this
[14/11/18, 1:09:43 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Take it/leave it.. exactly this. 

This isn't how you put a suggestion. It's an offer. Where you are showing your high-handedness again
[14/11/18, 1:10:05 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): Jason, 
u can interpret language any ways you want. 
if you think giving a factual feedback is 'strong language" that is your opinion.
[14/11/18, 1:10:28 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): coming to "high handedness" I used that language when you got condescending with "dear" etc., 

got it.
[14/11/18, 1:10:43 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): as an admin pl put yourself on a higher pedestal
[14/11/18, 1:10:49 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): let us follow your example
[14/11/18, 1:10:51 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): 🙂
[14/11/18, 1:11:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Why we prefer sharing things on Group rather than sharing the DB:*
1. Won’t prefer sharing private data with the public. 
2. Sharing on group creates an opportunity for all pushstarters and people in their network: It won’t be the case if we share the DB.
3. Although there is PUSH in our name, we prefer a PULL methodology. I would not prefer Pushstarters PUSHING requests to me till the time I am interested. I have an option whether to reply on the query or not depending upon my interest: It won’t be the case if we share the DB.
4. We want Pushstaters to establish first connect on our channel and then exchange their personal info.
[14/11/18, 1:11:13 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): first you condescend, and then you say I am high handed, nice 🙂
[14/11/18, 1:11:44 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We have WhatsApp group where you guys don't interact and Offline meetups which you guys don't attend.
[14/11/18, 1:11:56 PM] Neeraj Joshi: for establishing the first connect
[14/11/18, 1:12:02 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): there you go,,

wasn't this a good way to communicate ?

thanks for sharing Neeraj
[14/11/18, 1:12:45 PM] Rajiv Lulla (ps): hmm ok, got it.
[14/11/18, 1:15:06 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you guys start using our channels effectively like in other cities, you won't feel a need of a DB ❤
[14/11/18, 1:16:50 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Chill machas @919600226407 @919849098149
[14/11/18, 1:17:02 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Its already hot outside, don't make it hot here as well
[14/11/18, 1:17:10 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Winter h bhai
[14/11/18, 1:17:16 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Kuch bhi bolta h
[14/11/18, 1:17:17 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Haah
[14/11/18, 1:17:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Mumbai :(
[14/11/18, 1:17:29 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): 👀
[14/11/18, 1:18:41 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Mumbai is also not that hot
[14/11/18, 1:18:48 PM] Jeet (pushstart): *haan it is winter
[14/11/18, 3:05:18 PM] Supriya Sharma (ps): Hey, anyone has blue cross society number- hyd.

[16/11/18, 9:09:35 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Proud moment of the year. *Apple VP* recognized and appreciated *NANOS*.

*"The way it's shaping up is quite amazing. I believe it changes the way we think and use technology. Looking forward for it"* he said.
[16/11/18, 9:34:03 PM] ‪+91 83741 68954‬: 👌
[16/11/18, 9:44:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Where?
[16/11/18, 9:44:35 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Where?
[16/11/18, 10:46:36 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: After seeing the demo of NANOS through SKYPE
[16/11/18, 10:47:15 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Could have recorded it. 🙁
[16/11/18, 10:47:32 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): We make sure we record all official conversations.
[16/11/18, 10:48:09 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: That was a custom demo he asked for. Couldn't go with recording.
[16/11/18, 10:50:09 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: But will be getting official testimonial soon.
[16/11/18, 11:06:18 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): all the best
[16/11/18, 11:06:19 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): any website
[16/11/18, 11:06:20 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): ?
[16/11/18, 11:10:00 PM] Jason Samuel (pushstart): Waiting for it
[16/11/18, 11:13:17 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: https://youtu.be/mKvzng4ns-Q

You could have a brief understanding through this. I've demonstrated the usecases like virtual assistant, virtual developer, virtual designer which could create real stuff.
[16/11/18, 11:13:36 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Will share ASAP
[16/11/18, 11:15:39 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): great
[16/11/18, 11:17:28 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: You could have a look at it & share the feedback. Next video, will be uploading this Monday. I also welcome the suggestions of usecases you want to see in next video. Or, I could make custom demos for you as per the respective field.
[16/11/18, 11:18:31 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): how is it diff than text rank ( the message feature)
[16/11/18, 11:22:46 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: I didn't heard about it, I'll comment on it once I do my basic research on that. But if we take chatbots with or without AI and this. This is more of YOU, this doesn't work on predefined datasets or algorithms. At every experience it creates it's own algorithm especially for that particular situation. This makes it responds more as you than giving generic contextual answers.
[16/11/18, 11:24:26 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): any research paper on this?
[16/11/18, 11:25:23 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Nope
[16/11/18, 11:25:55 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): very keen on understanding how the design part worked
[16/11/18, 11:26:38 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Possibly we could go with one on one demo session sometime next week to give you clear understanding.
[16/11/18, 11:26:47 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): i understand the development service module, still not sure if CRM can be developed not
[16/11/18, 11:27:28 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: We could build entire ERP system through this.
[16/11/18, 11:27:56 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): would love to see a demo
[16/11/18, 11:28:49 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: I've continuous demos until Tuesday, we could schedule anytime from Wednesday.
[16/11/18, 11:30:00 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): sure will pm
[16/11/18, 11:33:06 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Suggestions that I got for the next video.

Virtual HR
Virtual Marketing guy
Virtual Telecaller
Virtual Singer


If you've anymore you could add, will make my next demo video on this.
[16/11/18, 11:36:48 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): so can i make your tool using your tool?
[16/11/18, 11:37:41 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Like NANOS using NANOS?
[16/11/18, 11:37:50 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): yes
[16/11/18, 11:38:49 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): i can make 3d printer using 3d printer, so can i make nanos using nanos?
[16/11/18, 11:39:04 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: It's limited to be a virtual brain not to create one. It might be misused if I take out the limitation.
[16/11/18, 11:39:18 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): if yes wouldn't it run your platform obsolete?
[16/11/18, 11:39:41 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): hacking is not that hard anymore.
[16/11/18, 11:39:53 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): well it never was lol
[16/11/18, 11:44:34 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: You're right, hacking ain't a tough thing anymore. But I'm trying my best to make it hard to hack. Bringing brain level, service level, & experience level encryption. Which means, in a transaction between two virtual brains, it takes the brain fingerprint of both at the time of transaction, & uses it to encrypt that particular transaction. Brain will be evolving continuously, so, it's very tough to hack it.
[16/11/18, 11:50:27 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: N user data won't be stored in a database. Neural schema is created where all the intelligence points would be connected as the neurons in brain. Technically they're completely independent, which means like a million/billion/trillion virtual neurons would be created based on experiences. N data won't be shared, it'll always be within user's virtual brain, giving 100% privacy to the users.
[16/11/18, 11:50:57 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): gotcha
[16/11/18, 11:51:10 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): lets schedule a demo soon
[16/11/18, 11:51:15 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): i have been reading on this
[16/11/18, 11:51:21 PM] Anupama (pushstart): Guys it’s 12 pm
[16/11/18, 11:51:25 PM] Anupama (pushstart): 12am
[16/11/18, 11:51:40 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Sure
[16/11/18, 11:51:49 PM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Sorry for the disturbance
[17/11/18, 12:00:15 AM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): Guys, anyone here working on a startup concerned with politics?
[17/11/18, 12:15:31 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): This is like Westworld :)
[17/11/18, 12:17:41 AM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: What is Westworld? I'm not aware of it.
[17/11/18, 12:19:02 AM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: You mean that TV series?
[17/11/18, 12:19:11 AM] Harshal (Pushstart): Yes
[17/11/18, 12:19:19 AM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Gotcha
[17/11/18, 10:11:29 AM] ‪+91 95024 44362‬: Being successful is easy, as no one expects anything from you. But staying successful is tough, as people starts expecting you to be better all the time.
[18/11/18, 2:35:37 PM] Harshit Jain (pswhatsapp): Anyone here or knows someone who's experienced in growing Pinterest for businesses?

It could basically takes your intelligence, and create the virtual YOU, do your tasks as you do. I've made a video on virtual communicator, virtual developer, & virtual designer earlier. Now I'm eager to see what all you gonna make through this.

With the huge support for IoT, we could also build and control smart devices which works on your personal intelligence.

I believe this is gonna disrupt the way we work, and we see the technology. By the way, welcome to family of NANOS.

[24/11/18, 7:18:24 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!                                                                           

*Where to Apply?*

[25/11/18, 10:47:08 AM] Yathiraj (pushstart): Customer Buys a Product/ Service only if he believes in your Product or Service.

However, even before he believes Your Product or Service, he is trying to decide if he can Trust you. Hope you agree.

So, it’s important that Customer Buys you (Trusts you) before he can Buy from you.

Guys,
A friend of mine is organising a fest in hyderabad and wishes to partner with restaurants across the city.
Is there any way possible to get a curated list of restaurants along with their managers' contact details?

P. S - excluding the likes of  Zomato, just dial as they give the number of the restaurant and  connecting with the management becomes a longer tedious process.
[25/11/18, 10:23:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Any help here?

It’s a mobile app and way complex to develop alone. So I started looking for senior iOS app developers. 

Should I hire one senior developer or assign the project to a freelancer?

If hiring is the best option, I don’t have budget for a senior developer. How can I handle this? 

Looking for your suggestions.

[12/12/18, 5:58:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s the idea?
[12/12/18, 5:59:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Focus on shipping out the mvp asap and testing it first rather than investing a lot of time, effort and resources in building the complex product

[12/12/18, 6:25:04 PM] ‪+91 89789 48952‬: Idea - Photo sharing platform 

The competitors are billion dollar comapanies. 

Doing just a mvp won’t help. The idea is different and 10x better than the competitors. But MVP won’t be suffice for this.

[12/12/18, 6:43:18 PM] ‪+91 89789 48952‬: Yeah. True. 

We demonstarted our little prototype to 100 strangers way back in June. 

I made that statement based on the feedback we received. 

I hope they gave honest feedback
[12/12/18, 6:44:35 PM] ‪+91 89789 48952‬: Still in Amazon wishlist. 

But I read on some blog that a startup should be at least 10x than competitor. 

So, we reiterated our basic prototype few times to reach that.
[12/12/18, 6:48:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Great

[12/12/18, 6:51:08 PM] Aditya Arya (pushstart): 100% true 

a simple MVP won't help for a photosharing app to be successful, it must be available on all platforms and must have top-notch UI-UX. 

people don't care about the tech as they cannot see or know the tech. They care about experience and looks. 

Best of luck with Google photos and Apple photos apps, making a change in users comfort will be a challenge.

[13/12/18, 6:32:16 PM] ‪+91 83318 41424‬: Hello everyone,

Thank you for adding me to this group..

I am Sravan Raj, founder of Mody5, a startup based out of Hyderabad. We, at Mody5 aims to bring fashion for cars by accessorizing and customizing the cars. 

Now a days, most of the car owners want their car to be unique or some comfort facilities for their cars. With a thorugh market research, we found that this customization market is very unorganised and fragmented with prices and qualities of products & services changing with each and every car decor. 

So, we are creating an online marketplace which can oragnize this unorganized market . And our USP is that we provide doorstep installation for the products & services we offer and personalized solutions for individual customers. 

As a part of this, we are looking for a co-founder who can handle the tech part of the company. So, anyone interested, please ping me separately and I can explain about the company in detail. 
So, let's celebrate cars!!! Cheers!!!
[13/12/18, 6:32:50 PM] Rupesh Garg (ps): I feel this pain!

[25/12/18, 11:50:30 AM] ‪+91 83318 41424‬: Hello Pushstarters..Wish you a happy christmas!!!

I am Sravan Raj, founder of Mody5, a startup based out of Hyderabad. We, at Mody5 aims to bring fashion for cars by accessorizing and customizing the cars. 

Now a days, most of the car owners want their car to be unique or some comfort facilities for their cars. With a thorugh market research, we found that this customization market is very unorganised and fragmented with prices and qualities of products & services changing with each and every car decor. 

So, we are creating an online marketplace which can disrupt this unorganized market . And our USP is that we provide doorstep installation for the products & services we offer and personalized solutions for individual customers. 

As a part of this, we are looking for a co-founder who can handle the tech part of the company. So, anyone interested, please ping me separately and I will explain about the company in detail. 
So, let's celebrate cars!!! Cheers!!!
[26/12/18, 1:05:17 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hey Fellow Entrepreneurs,
It's time to take a step back and THINK!

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

[30/12/18, 3:17:32 PM] ‪+91 89789 48952‬: If one have a complex app idea and a seed fund of 5 lakhs 

The seed fund isn’t enough to hire senior iOS developer, senior android developer and senior backend developer. (All senior level devs as the app is complex). 

What can one do in this situation? 

Freelance the project to a freelancer and hire mid-level developers for follow on features post launch?
[30/12/18, 3:53:08 PM] Uday Krishna (pushstart): It would depend a lot on the context of what the app is how long would it take before it can start bringing in revenue and what is the technical proficiency of the founder

But here are my 2 cents on how I would try to approach this situation

Before the answer here's a piece of advice 

Don't just jump in and build the complex app, try to make an mvp (minimum viable product) first by focusing on the exact pain point the app is trying to address. 
Try to arrive at this point by spending as little as possible without compromising on the experience you intended to deliver and see how it performs in the market in case you need to make any changes those funds you saved up will be a of a lot of help

Freelancer vs dev depends a lot on the amount of effort you are willing to put in to the dev process.

If you are willing to spend a lot of time in the development process (atleast a couple of hours daily) hire a dev. If you are technically proficient try hiring a junior Dev and guiding them through.

Hiring a solo senior dev won't actually help you a lot, you'd be better off hiring a freelancer instead

In case you do not have that much time on your hands go ahead and hire a freelancer instead 
But that way you won't have a lot of visibility into your application so in case you want to make any changes in future it'll be a bit difficult

Tldr; 
If you are willing to invest a lot your of time in the development process and are technically proficient go ahead and hire a dev if not you'll be better off hiring a freelancer

are buzzwords both in employment and efficiency. 
remember, at one time, @Reliance bought crude at almost 4-5% more efficient pricing compared to the GOVT 😉

[22/01/19, 1:06:04 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yo Pushstarters,
There is a lot of confusion around whether to add your friends to FB and then here or the other way around. 

In the past 2 weeks, a lot of pushstarters have reached out to me asking *how to add people in their network to this community?*

It’s pretty simple, just share this form with the interested folks in your network, we will add them here directly after going through their profile once 😋😋

Sounds good? 

Then start sharing this registration form with fellow founders in your network:

Cheers!

yes they are India specific.

[23/01/19, 11:01:28 AM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): This will save you 5-10k but you will still need a CA and CS. If you are knowledgeable in MoA etc then go online, else offline with a trusted guy is better
[23/01/19, 11:10:35 AM] ‪+91 89789 48952‬: Thank you 😊
[23/01/19, 11:12:11 AM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): 👍

Do let me know if you need a good local reference in Hyderabad
[23/01/19, 1:54:34 PM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): They have CA and CS services too I believe
[23/01/19, 1:56:12 PM] Jitendra Singh (pushstart): I meant to say that if you go via an offline person, the annual cost can be offset a little. 

I registered my company via them, then moved to offline channel. Their cookie cutter approach wasn't working for me.
[23/01/19, 2:22:42 PM] Aarvind Gogenini (pushstart): Apart from incorporation, I have similar experience. They customer service is pathetic.

[01/02/19, 11:30:43 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Hola Pushstarters!

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

.
.
.
.

Rings a bell?? 🤔🤔
.
.
.
Yeah, you're right- It's *#PushQnA.* 😎😎

We're back with an *all new* version of *PushQnA*, starting *next week*.🔥🔥

So what's new?

PushQnA is not just gonna be a QnA session, but in addition to that the host would be sharing *original content* freshly brewed for Pushstarters! 

The content would be shared *3 days prior* to the QnA session and would be *101 themed* pertaining to the topic.

This content is specially for those who are curious about the topic and want to gain some basic knowledge much before the QnA. 

We're excited to begin with the new revamped PushQnA, which would happen *every Tuesday at 9:30 pm* 🤩🤩

Stay Tuned for further updates!!
