[26/04/18, 8:00:18 PM] ‪+241 02 00 15 74‬: Hi Puahstart folks!

Firstly kudos to the idea of puahstart and the people behind it. 

I am a Modi, with no connection to politics, cricket, or bank scams!

A kind and passionate soul, and a project analyst (operations not IT) at Olam International Limited in Gabon, Africa. 

I love to build, from ideas to strategies to implementation.  I hold concrete experience in supply chain, operation, and project management working in 3 countries across the globe.  I have been trained under Al Gore- the former vice president of the US under the project climate reality.  My work experience varies from non-profits to startups to MNCs.  Working and traveling in 11 countries, I have learned a lot about people and I can form meaningful connections and collaborations. 

What am I seeking  for? 
An opportunity to work in a challenging and exciting role in a startup/nonprofit. 

Will be grateful and keen to discuss it further, if anyone over here has an opportunity in mind to offer/recommend/advise. :) 

Where can I help?
In all above mentioned fields I would love to share my experiences, discuss ideas and projects.  Additionally I can be of some help to the youth seeking for any international youth forums, conferences and fellowships.  

Merci beaucoup! 
Vivek

[26/04/18, 10:09:33 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Check mail ID if correctly filled there in form
[26/04/18, 10:09:48 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Usually this is the reason...  Incorrect spelling

[26/04/18, 10:13:49 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Check settingscfor desired email ID,  in,  out both
[26/04/18, 10:15:47 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): recommend using SMTP to send emails from WordPress instead of using the default PHP mail function. As mail service provider checks for origination IP if it's your website instead of the service provider ex gmail,  yahoo. It won't even reach spam folder and get blocked
[26/04/18, 10:16:52 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Which plugin is configured to be used in wp for the form?
[26/04/18, 10:17:53 PM] Satyam (pushstart): Contact Form 7

If human error eliminated... 
Cab do the technical troubleshooting

[26/04/18, 11:31:30 PM] Mahesh Tilwe (pushstart): is email id registered in cpanel? (if you are using) cpanel doesn't allow send you email through scripts if not registered.
[26/04/18, 11:31:59 PM] shashank (pushstart): Always you have to keep them differently hosted!
[26/04/18, 11:33:23 PM] shashank (pushstart): Use MailGun to send transactional emails on Wordpress & normal emails via Google apps! CPanel thing is 90ish thing and outdated!
[26/04/18, 11:36:24 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Out of curiosity ..when ppl say interns ..do they mean PAID interns?

[26/04/18, 11:42:21 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Most start up this days won’t unpaid interns and expect them to work like full time employee so Just told what’s happening in industry.
[26/04/18, 11:43:52 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Both work depends on need,  for small not important work... Unpaid interns get live experience and you a little less headache on your important guys workload... 

Paid ones you try to retain them... As can mould them to the company needs,  requirements and culture... 
Be warned they may learn some un wanted cultures too while at it 😂 JK

[27/04/18, 1:04:12 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Haha. Okay, soo just a small case study. A friend of mine organised a beer and food networking event at his startup office. Invited all BITSians in entire bangalore. To say, there was no entry fee but in the process, he got half of his team for his next venture. The cost for organising such an event was less than a lac but the value generated was insane.
[27/04/18, 1:05:07 PM] Jeet (pushstart): It’s luck based. People might turn and nothing happens.
[27/04/18, 1:05:12 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Fast forward 2 yrs, his startup successfully got acquired and the people who stuck through the two years got handsomely rewarded.
[27/04/18, 1:06:06 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): If you take care of small things and little details, you can increase the probability of success.

[28/04/18, 6:32:55 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Rules,  policies are provided on their site I guess detailed ok
[28/04/18, 6:33:33 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Earnings start over a Million views I think too
[28/04/18, 6:34:45 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): CPM (cost per thousand) is an industry term that represents revenue per thousand views. In 2013, the average income for each YouTube content creator was $7.60per every thousand views. A video with 500 views would have earned roughly $3.80. A video like Gangnam Style with a billion views would earn $7.8 million.

[28/04/18, 6:35:48 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Yes you can...
[28/04/18, 6:35:56 PM] Gautam Jain (pushstart): I guess..it also depends upon the viewers profile, location etc

[28/04/18, 6:43:19 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Could you elaborate it a bit? Like what i rate the school i dont like?
[28/04/18, 6:43:39 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): @919871762488 Anything you can work together here on?
[28/04/18, 6:43:56 PM] Gautam Jain (pushstart): Basically...it's a review platform for school, colleges, coaching classes, activity classes etc..
[28/04/18, 6:44:06 PM] Siddharth Rath (Pushstart): CPM for India focused channels tends to be less. Also recently CPM has been falling as data explosion has lead to an increase in views
[28/04/18, 6:44:34 PM] Gautam Jain (pushstart): Any parent or student can share give ratings and reviews in their Education instt...we will publish them..
[28/04/18, 6:44:35 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Its down to half of what u mentioned, for india.
[28/04/18, 6:44:42 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): On what basis?
[28/04/18, 6:44:57 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): I can use this to defame entire colleges, playing with careers?! Cant i?
[28/04/18, 6:45:12 PM] Gautam Jain (pushstart): Education institutions can get listed with us and promote their brand at same time..likes of Glassdoor or Zomato
[28/04/18, 6:46:21 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): I get the idea.. i want to understand the execution. Its not like zomato bcz its not a one time thing. I would rate a college once in an year or once in a couple of years
[28/04/18, 6:46:48 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Also, i could rate it for a million other reasons which cant be factored in a linear scale of 5.
[28/04/18, 6:47:13 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): I caught at first sight it as *Glassdoor* itself 🤔🤭
[28/04/18, 6:47:25 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Also, who benefits from this data?
[28/04/18, 6:48:58 PM] Abodid (pushstart): A lot of it depends on the ads being played over the video and in which location. 
The best scenario is something like you produce content in INDIA and that is played back more in US and hence the US ads gets played over them and you get a high value add on coz of arbitrage.
[28/04/18, 6:49:36 PM] Siddharth Rath (Pushstart): Yes!
[28/04/18, 6:49:37 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Anyone would. 😅😅👀😬
[28/04/18, 6:53:05 PM] Gautam Jain (pushstart): Guys...thanks for introspection and ideas...but at this stage...I need co-founder...instead of brainstorming on idea...as it's already under execution..hope u will appreciate...
[28/04/18, 6:53:42 PM] Gautam Jain (pushstart): Ofcourse...if anyone here is slightly interested..we can do detailed chat/meet ups...to take it forward..

[28/04/18, 8:19:36 PM] Vineet (pushstart): Bro.. There is Siksha.com and College Khabri.. India Today comes with the list every year.. The quality of education will also have to depend on the quality of curriculum and teachers.. Manipal did it well in Private Sector. IITs have set the mark in terms of rigiour.. Trust me St. Xavier's College Mumbai is autonomous and making student earn their degree.. Most of the students are not serious about the rigour.. Trust me the product you are trying to make has its own challenges and monetization is the next level game.. Feel free to bounce your idea across with me.. Will give you my critical feedback..

I am Umang Kumar Rathi. Worked 5.5 years in new rocket engine development in ISRO, just done with my MBA from ISB and joining Future group in their new tech development.

Look forward to fruitful associations and new friends.

[02/05/18, 4:23:34 PM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Soon you'll be able to latch on to your home or office wi-fi broadband to make calls to mobile phones as well as landlines
Telecom operators, and other companies who obtain a telephony licence, will be able to offer you a new mobile number that will not require a SIM.
Stuck in a bad signal area, or getting the dreaded sign that there is no mobile network at all? Soon you'll be able to latch on to your home or office wi-fi broadband to make calls to mobile phones as well as landlines, with the government on Tuesday approving a proposal to allow internet telephony in the country.

[02/05/18, 8:56:44 PM] Ameet (pushstart): I think discussions should also be allowed. Many times there have been good discussions resulting in great information
[02/05/18, 8:58:07 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): That is still an unsolved problem
[02/05/18, 8:58:18 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Long form vs short form discussion on whatsapp vs facebook
[02/05/18, 8:58:21 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Who watches what
[02/05/18, 8:58:58 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): but out of all ths discussion u miss out lot of important msgs..moment i see 100+ unread msg i just scroll through without reading
[02/05/18, 8:59:10 PM] Ameet (pushstart): We have to accept that there may be a few discussions which are not worth... But most of them have been really great
[02/05/18, 8:59:44 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): This and all problems in life will be sorted once we move to pushstarts very own website and community app. Coming soon at the app stores near you!
[02/05/18, 9:00:08 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): *
[02/05/18, 9:02:20 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Just generally asking, how early would you want to see pushstarts own webapp n stuff. If at all?
[02/05/18, 10:52:16 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): 👍 we're working on it. Great points @919975715336 @918928126784 Would pm you guys on some product feedback.

[02/05/18, 10:55:42 PM] Amrik (pushstart): Depends on the location, for Andheri West they quote 11K for fixed and come down to 9K if one pays for 3 months

[02/05/18, 11:00:45 PM] Ameet (pushstart): 👍👍
[02/05/18, 11:21:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: So I have been asked and told multiple times to allow discussions on the WhatsApp group and I don’t really encourage that. 

The reason is: 

I want maximum pushstaters to become part of the discussion and get benefitted:  
 
3 type of people become part of the discussion: 
1. The one who starts it: 1%  
2. The one who contributes: 4% 
3. The one who reads and learn: 95% 

If things are discussed on WhatsApp group: 
Total strength: 250 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 250 

On FB group: 
Strength: 8k 
Maximum pushstarters that can be benefited: 8k 

See the difference? 

The information shared in the discussion is priceless and a larger impact will be created if we can funnel all of it to the FB group. 

That's why: 
1. Share Idea
2. Launch Startup 
3. Ask Questions 
4. Share Content 

ON FB GROUP 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/Pushstarter

So let's impact the lives of thousands of entrepreneurs by doing all the discussions on the FB group. 

Thanks
[02/05/18, 11:25:12 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): Hope above post clears the idea behind no discussion on whatsapp.

[03/05/18, 11:49:26 PM] Umang (pushstart): My father runs a small business back home in Assam and I have been looking at various things which can make his work easy.

As you are aware, there is a lot of requirement of paper work in this new environment of GST. An idea which I thought would be quite suitable for small businesses in the city and most businesses in rural areas (due to lack of manpower to work on live billing on a computer) is creating a system which can help them to carry on their business on paper slips and paper bills, yet getting their data online.
System has two parts - 1 imaging part, which is a fixed focus camera mounted properly in a box, where the cashier keeps the incoming or outgoing bill. The same is uploaded online. Using special mark on the corner of the paper, segregation can be automated. Further the processing can be done on a centralized basis. This helps in easing up the filing requirements, and the businessmen can concentrate on what they know best.
[03/05/18, 11:50:24 PM] Umang (pushstart): I didnt found any suitable scanner system at low cost and hence abandoned the whole idea.

[10/05/18, 2:33:43 AM] Harshal (uberpass): It has taken 70 years for India to Reach 2.5 Trillion Dollar Economy, though India will take only 7-8 more years to reach 5 Trillion i.e. the Total amount of Money that was made in Last 70 years would be made again in the next 7-8 Years. The Question is how much will you make? I have absolutely no doubt that the ones who can catch a few right trends in next 7-8 years are going to be very very rich. China took 5 years to double, US took 10 years to double from 2.4 to 5 trillion$, it is estimated that India will take 7 years to get there.

 

The Idea is simple, there will be 100’s of entrepreneurs out there who will increase their profit 10-15x from current levels, they will grow at 30-40% and we need to back them. The Biggest Trend is India.

 

Within India there will be Sector Trends that will change every 3-4 years like:

 

Automobiles – India Sold a whooping 2 Crore Two Wheelers India V/S 1.7 Crore Two Wheelers sold by China. Interestingly India Sold 33 Lakh Passenger Cars in FY2018 V/S 2.4 Crore in India. Slowly but Surely in the next 10 years we are confident that India will sell 1 Crore+ Cars and the average ticket size of a car would also Increase rapidly. Out of these 33 Lakh Cars, more than 50% i.e. 18 Lakh Cars were sold by Maruti alone. Maruti has a Market cap of 2.6 Lakh Crores and did Profit of about 8000 Crores in FY2018.

 

Financials – This is one space where the Opportunity is Largest into all Three Spaces i.e. Lending, Protection and Wealth Management.

 

Lending – The Top 45 Business houses in India are 50% of Nation’s banking debt even after nationalization of banks. The Top 20% of India is well banked and Opportunities are now on the lower ticket size retail lending (80% of Population). With Upsurge of MFI, SME Lending, consumer finance, affordable home loans, Retail Credit is a big trend which are typically small ticket size loans with higher NIM spreads. India’s Credit needs will grow at 15-16%, whereas Smart private Bankers/NBFC can grow faster at 20-30% easy for next 7-8 years. Their is an Opportunity to grow look book by 3-5x easily.

 

Protection – This Again is a multiyear theme, from Life to Auto insurance to Health to crop to even your cellphone. Here not only there will be Growth of 15-17% in the general Market but there will be large Market share shift from PSU Insurers to Private companies, we believe Private Insurers can grow 20%+ for a long long time.

 

Wealth Management & Investment- We Strongly believe that Markets are underestimating the financialization of savings as a theme, the total Profit pool of top 5 Asset management companies (57% Market Share) in India is just 1800 Crores in FY2017. The Profit Pool is so small that one midsized popular hedge fund Pershing Square made more Profit than the Entire Indian Asset Management Industry, We at Stallion Asset have absolutely no doubt that the Profit Pool will grow multi fold in next 5-10 years and there will be massive wealth Created in this space.

 

Air Conditioners – I hope the Indian summer is not killing you because you are in A/C room right now reading this blog but you will be suprised to know that only 4% of Indian Households own a Air Conditioner, (10% Indian own Air-Cooler) whereas 85% of Indian Household have fans. In China the Penetration of Air conditioners grew from 8% in 1995 to 70% in 2004. Voltas is the Market Leader with 24% Market share in A/C in India and Sold 10 Lakh Air conditioners this year and will do a Profit of 650 Crores in FY2018 and has a 20,000 Crores Market Cap.  10 years from today, I dont know what profits Voltas will make but I am confident that India’s Penetration of Air Conditioners will go up from 4% to at-least 15%.

 

Large Format Retail Stores- There are 3700 Tesco Stores in UK, 4100 Walmart Stores in USA where in India, D-Mart has 155 Stores and Big Bazaar 260. Remember The population of UK is 6 Crores, the Population of USA is 32 Crores and Population of India is 125 Crores.

 

Conclusion – I repeat “MORE MONEY WILL BE CREATED IN THE NEXT 7-8 YEARS THAN INDIANS CREATED IN LAST 70 YEARS” There are opportunities to make it large. There will be cyclical ups and downs but smart stock pickers would easily make 10x in next 10 years. Don’t Miss this BIGGEST TREND EVER by trading nifty for 100 points, options, Futures etc.

Hello everyone

I need to Hire 2 -3 people for blue collar jobs for Mumbai / Thane / Navi Mumbai. Looking for Street Smart guys, SSC / HSC / Graduates are preferred but a degree is not mandatory. We can train people depending on which role they are suitable for.

Kindly help me with recommndation or connect to the candidates (if you have someone in mind) or the consultants or a good job portal  for blue collar job. 

I will have a recurring requirement. 

TIA

Maybe could have more eloquent both yours and the host as well. But that will anyway come with time. Kudos. ✌🏻✌🏻

Wanted to know how crowdfunding works for sponsoring education? What do sponsors get in return. I hadn't heard of crowdfunding for education hence the curiosity
[13/05/18, 5:57:58 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Happiness, confidence, 

And crowdfunding for education in my cases never had been done by donors with any expectations of things in return except the thing that they believe me and my profile and works.

[13/05/18, 6:27:59 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): This sounds good. Do u think this can be done for raising startup funds for a business too..just some funds to setup a factory. Basically u raised money from strangers in exchange for nothing. Can this work for setting up a small factory too?
[13/05/18, 6:30:12 PM] Kapil Agarwal: Congrats bro. best of luck!
[13/05/18, 6:31:18 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Nope it shouldn’t work. 
Since you want money for doing business.

It works in case of social start ups but not usually for profit start ups.

Alternatively you can offer your product in lieu of money.
[13/05/18, 6:31:44 PM] Jeet (pushstart): It can work if your Personal Network is strong enough.
[13/05/18, 6:39:10 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Yeah I know I can offer products but that's not free money. I understand how people can give for social causes. I give for those too. But I think education is different. He will make money by getting an education so it almost sounds the same thing. When I was in US my roommate had to drop out and even workef illegally to get money for tuition. There are tens of thousands of people taking loans for education. If people give money for free for education a big industry would come to s stop. It seems there is more to the story .....
[13/05/18, 6:40:11 PM] Anjali (pushstart): Good points.
[13/05/18, 6:40:12 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): Having helped a couple of Crowdfunding campaigs i hv noticed that they work well for social cause and for some products where the customers get first hand use of the same.
[13/05/18, 6:40:24 PM] Anjali (pushstart): Great! Congrats!😊
[13/05/18, 6:41:40 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Would love to know the platform and see how the campaign was conducted.
[13/05/18, 6:42:04 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Nikhil helped many people selflessly.

So those are people who funded him and few alum of IIT BHU.
[13/05/18, 6:42:12 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): U can check Catapooolt the founder is a very good friend
[13/05/18, 6:42:20 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): Ketto was another
[13/05/18, 6:42:41 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): But again while raising crowdfunding chosing the right platform is important
[13/05/18, 6:42:53 PM] Anjali (pushstart): True! Almost everyone knows him from BHU😊
[13/05/18, 6:43:00 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Ok so these are basically personal contacts and not strangers right..that's a whole different story..
[13/05/18, 6:43:22 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Some strangers might have helped him but Start will be always with known ones.
[13/05/18, 6:43:24 PM] Anjali (pushstart): partly. You personally might not know all alumni.
[13/05/18, 6:44:06 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Plus he runs internship and jobs groups. Waha Sab stranger hi hai. 
So usme se Many might have helped.
[13/05/18, 6:46:04 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Ok this makes sense. Raising from friends and family is nice to start
[13/05/18, 6:48:24 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): I was just wondering if there is really a platform where people just come and start donating money to strangers just to help. That would have been a crazy awesome platform. Hence the discussion..thanks for the insights

[13/05/18, 6:49:33 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): Purpose is important
[13/05/18, 6:49:42 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Are there agencies that help organize such campaigns in exchange for commission
[13/05/18, 6:50:11 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): Y do u need agencies. The platform has a team to help
[13/05/18, 6:52:54 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): And no offence but literally everything can be spinned into a cause. Helping a women entrepreneur start...helping a farmer grow..helping a young boy make a mark..are these usually such storylines? I dont mean to offend anyone but it doesn't seem realistic..I will check out the platform..how do these platforms ensure money is actually utilized for what it is claimed? This is just for knowledge
[13/05/18, 6:55:17 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Knowledge chahiye? Fb group pe post karo! Post for crowdfunding business models and opportunities

[13/05/18, 8:29:35 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Nope. Not easy
[13/05/18, 8:35:15 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): People-. i raised this time 98% from people whom I met or who met me on LinkedIn in past 2 weeks.

Its a matter of trust and ane big motive- you have contribute.

Ppl noticed my Post of crowdfunding campaign, but have they also noticed my previous post on data science resources and actionable information?

Those who did and were benefited - came for helping me.

People believe my content 1st than me on LinkedIn as they saw me through my Social media content share.

That's how it works. 

And also , this time i raised from corporate also in lieu of some help to them 

I never preferred Any platform due to their platform fees and so did people who funded me
[13/05/18, 9:18:21 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): This sounds great ..can I reach out next week..to see if something similar can be implemented for a startup...let's experiment

[14/05/18, 11:14:30 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: FYi I used to do a lot of unpaid events- I found people would take me for granted and also not value what I was bringing to the table enough. Now i no longer do unpaid events unless they line up with something else I am trying to achieve .. as in there has to be a tangible benefit however ancillary..
[14/05/18, 11:16:34 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): For me now: Money is not the concern as what I have is enough for my living.
If I need it, crowd can help me always.

Your point is correct though but that might be applicable at later stages when I am losing something out and thus the time compensation in terms of its apt value is always asked upfront
[14/05/18, 11:17:41 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: its fine to pay ure dues when ure just starting out- but make sure it doesent go on forever- ure time is valuable..

[19/05/18, 10:29:35 AM] Mansi Bora (pushstart): Hello Pushstarters!
My name is Mansi Bora. I alongwith a group of Bitsians are working on an e-commerce based handicrafts startup. The idea revolves around the need to have a central marketplace for the handicrafts from all across. We have a profile based system for artisans and their groups where they can list the products they make and buyers can choose from them. Their profile also includes tags of the kind of art they specialise in and this way, they can receive a project/query concerning the artform (tag). Thus, it will be a place to receive projects as well as a marketplace for the products. 
I am here looking for further connections with people who might be working in the same sector or any leads concerning the idea.
Thank you!

CTAs are not clearly visible. they dont stand out. everything is just plain text. Add to cart doesnt even appear as a button.
2. Put "Buy Now" or "View More"   buttons. Being a technical person I know that the images are clickable or atleast I tried to click to see if it works. Non techy users will just be lost on how to buy.
3. Add to Cart button is at the bottom of the page and to check the cart i have to scroll to the top. Why not put the Cart button floating at the top etc
4. Messaging should go into slightly different colors. Example Added to cart was just a overlay with same color as background..with an icon which did not go well with the message. At first I thought there was some issue.
5. Why not allow checkout as guest. I dont want to give you my facebook or G+ access or i dont want to create my account just yet.

these are few of the things i observed within 5-7 mins of exploring. User convenience is more important than your design or look an feel...

I am Prathmesh Tokekar(Native of Nagpur ) student of BITS Pilani , Pilani Campus. 
I am a curious guy & a networker. I am in a voyage of understanding how world  &  businesses work. 

My expertise currently lie in the field of Digital Assets ( Domain names , Websites,Cryptocurrency ..etc) . 

I currently manage a small Portfolio of Domains & Cryptocurrency . 
In my 3 years of college I learned the following : (Not through college but online 🙃) :
Website Development , App Development , Domain name trading , Technical Analysis for publicly traded instruments , Ethereum Solidity Development , ICO analysis. 

But the most important thing that I have is the network that I built . I can very well say that name any country and I will find a contact there. 🤪
I have built deep contacts especially in Mainland China and plan to explore Blockchain & Crypto currency Markets through them .

You can hit me up for Digital Marketing , Website Development , App development , Import / Export from China & Crypto Currency related questions . 
I can connect you with right people in all these areas.
Thanks 🙏🏻🙏🏻

Actually I got in a small Telegram group of Indians Crypto enthusiasts that was formed back in 2015 . 

Have also met people who have been collecting Bitcoins from the time when sites use to give 1000s of coins for winning online games 😅

P.P.S.: I don't own a lot of  Bitcoins was very skeptical about it's fundamental even when it was at Rs 30,000  🙈.

[23/05/18, 2:59:38 PM] Harshal (uberpass): I am not targeting any specific city...just a question that popped in my head on reading above comment!
[23/05/18, 3:01:00 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Are sorry not specific for u. I mistakenly replied to ur comment but for all. 
All messaging for Bhubaneswar to me.

I was like why Bhubaneswar. Going to Bhubaneswar is more costly. Better fly from Chennai or Cochin or nearby
[23/05/18, 3:02:47 PM] Harshal (uberpass): Exactly
[23/05/18, 3:51:55 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Ya I get that. 😀😀reaching Bbsr will be costly.

[23/05/18, 8:24:50 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Flock has tried to Indianize slack. They have pretty good features, and robust.. adoption I haven't considered though.. for paytm, they have made sending money to a phone no. possible in India first..  these Indian products contest slack and WhatsApp payments respectively too..

[23/05/18, 8:26:12 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): flock is adaptive but a very functional alternative to slack, both technology and usage wise they are very smooth, have a good support as well
[23/05/18, 8:26:36 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Contesting n solving a problem n having a good product (tech platform) is different .... 
As much as I understand paytm can be lot better....
[23/05/18, 8:27:12 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): dont mix technology and product ! they are different things
[23/05/18, 8:27:27 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Contesting n solving a problem is what a product deos
[23/05/18, 8:27:34 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): *does
[23/05/18, 8:28:09 PM] Ameet (pushstart): U r right.... 
Tech wise both are great but product wise I find them poor n not well executed
[23/05/18, 8:28:18 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Connectplus link bro?
[23/05/18, 8:28:27 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): pray tell me ?
[23/05/18, 8:28:33 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Mirakee and sharechat looks promising
[23/05/18, 8:29:27 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Mirakee I don't know but share chat is definitely 👍👍
[23/05/18, 8:30:33 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i find paytm to be an amazing product, they made peer to peer money sending a thing, online wallets, recharge portal to multiple vendors, plus a low end ecommerce
[23/05/18, 8:30:40 PM] Ankit (fundhound): How do you guys define good tech and good product?
[23/05/18, 8:30:42 PM] Ankit (fundhound): Or this is as subjective as it can get?
[23/05/18, 8:32:23 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Well stated
[23/05/18, 8:33:24 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): good tech = no bugs, scalable, robust, has no down time, low maintenance and low performance issues
[23/05/18, 8:34:04 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): good product - has a strong UI/UX, good costumer satisfaction, long customer cycle, decent technology, upgradable along with being easy to use, complex yet simple and unique !
[23/05/18, 8:34:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Have u used it bro?
[23/05/18, 8:35:23 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i have and its a beautiful product with bad community management 1
[23/05/18, 8:35:37 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): *mirakee not share chat
[23/05/18, 8:35:43 PM] Ameet (pushstart): 👍
[23/05/18, 8:35:51 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Yes
[23/05/18, 8:35:55 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Nailed it
[23/05/18, 8:36:28 PM] Ameet (pushstart): But paytm does not qualify on most of these
[23/05/18, 8:36:30 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Paytm can be better, but they have done a pretty amazing job,  @919662915070 has made lot of good points.
[23/05/18, 8:37:26 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Ok. I agree they have done incredible job but still it's not a great product...

Yes it's a great technology
[23/05/18, 8:40:14 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Paytm has a very clean UI/UX, there is no confusion on the same ! dont confuse with design. Costumer has a high satisfaction from product end, less than 5% iteration, they have one of the smoothest technology, very easy to use, even my dad at 60 is able to use it, its simple with so many services so softly fit into the app
[23/05/18, 8:40:50 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Inspite of tech challenges,  drawbacks,  paytm has 100 MN downloads..(Freecharge has 10 MN downloads) active users actually matters, but the downloads say something..
[23/05/18, 8:41:19 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): infact its average in terms of technology !
[23/05/18, 8:41:59 PM] Ameet (pushstart): May be I m not able to put my points through correctly
[23/05/18, 8:42:08 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Agreed.
[23/05/18, 8:42:50 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): i have been using and connected with the founder since the days of it being a rechanrge website
[23/05/18, 8:42:53 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): We can do #pushhangout some time 🙂
[23/05/18, 8:43:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Attend pushmeetup this Sunday sirjiand
[23/05/18, 8:43:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *sirji
[23/05/18, 8:44:37 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Sounds good
[23/05/18, 8:44:47 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Yeah sure,  discussions like this can also be taken for a scheduled hangout so that interested peeps can join
[23/05/18, 8:45:09 PM] Ameet (pushstart): True
[23/05/18, 8:45:40 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): @919975715336 if you want to see amazing UI/UX and low key design, check and use reddit !
[23/05/18, 8:46:07 PM] Ameet (pushstart): True that. It's amazing
[23/05/18, 8:46:32 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): 4chan is also one amazing expample
[23/05/18, 8:47:07 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Zoho?
[23/05/18, 8:47:21 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): zoho is bad bro ! very bad
[23/05/18, 8:47:32 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Http://ConnectPlus.co we have a long long way to go 🙂
[23/05/18, 8:48:04 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Really? I've been using Zoho for a while now. No complaints yet
[23/05/18, 8:48:30 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): What's bad about Zoho?
[23/05/18, 8:48:34 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): I love mirakee, would love to see it coming as 'Instagram for writers.'
[23/05/18, 8:48:37 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): tech wise its pretty decent ! otherwsie its not that good
[23/05/18, 8:48:53 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): they need to hire a good community head !
[23/05/18, 8:49:02 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Was speaking tech wise
[23/05/18, 8:49:08 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): True.
[23/05/18, 8:49:16 PM] Sagar (Pushstart): I quite like Swiggy as a product
[23/05/18, 8:50:12 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): UX is off, costumer can get very confused to work around different products ! they lack connection between all modules. they are not seamless, bad design !
[23/05/18, 8:50:23 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): super buggy and they dont even care
[23/05/18, 8:50:36 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): all i get is - our tech team is aware and they are working on it
[23/05/18, 8:50:48 PM] Sagar (Pushstart): Haven't faced an issue so I can't really comment
[23/05/18, 8:51:17 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): not public bugs but then thoda test and see
[23/05/18, 8:54:32 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Didn't face the confusion issue but yes connection between modules could be made simpler and seamless
[23/05/18, 8:55:29 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Well at least it's the tech that they don't care about. Zomato doesn't care about customer service anymore lol
[23/05/18, 8:55:57 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Orders get cancelled 40 mins-1 hour after ordering
[23/05/18, 8:56:19 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Me🙋‍♂
[23/05/18, 8:56:27 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): May be.. Product itself should be able to solve challenges if any, than having a community manager, if you're looking it from a product perspective. From business perspective yes,  that may solve it..
[23/05/18, 8:56:37 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Rehne de
[23/05/18, 8:56:45 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Refunds for orders cancelled from their end never show up unless you follow up 100s of times. And even when you do, they're late
[23/05/18, 8:58:30 PM] Sagar (Pushstart): Guess I've just been lucky with swiggy then. Again whether a product is good or not is all about perspective and past experience na
[23/05/18, 8:59:19 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): That's was about zomato. Haven't faced any issues with swiggy customer service or heard of anyone who has
[23/05/18, 9:00:01 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Product quality is measured by a few factors not just satisfaction
[23/05/18, 9:00:29 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Sridhar Vembu - Zoho
Girish Mathrubootham-Freshdesk 
Avlesh Singh-Webengage 
Pallav Nandani-Fusion charts
Paras Chopra - Wingify
Crowdfire - Nischal Shetty
Pravin Jadhav - ex Freecharge

Mainly SaaS these are,  I'm into it. There are more from SaaS. May be I'll do a blog post on it.
[23/05/18, 9:01:11 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): Even with zomato being bad with service, it's a kickass product
[23/05/18, 9:03:49 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Yeah. Zomato is superb
[23/05/18, 9:10:47 PM] George (pushstart): Directii brothers 💁‍♂

[24/05/18, 6:36:24 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Yes, in this case you need to update your privacy policy document
[24/05/18, 6:36:28 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Also the terms and conditions
[24/05/18, 6:37:01 PM] Arjun (pushstart): Any idea where to find the right text to input?
[24/05/18, 6:37:51 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): See, this varies from business to business. You can always download texts from the internet but if you really wish to make this bulletproof
[24/05/18, 6:38:01 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): You need to take a corporate lawyer's help

An office where you can bicycle your way around or have a coffee on a bridge or even better meditate on a reclining chair? You must be wondering that this will be some Google or Amazon office in California. No! This is in India and that too in Nagpur! This analytics company in Nagpur India has set up an office with no cubicles and a novel neighborhood theme. The open design of the office is to encourage its analytics workforce to work collaboratively, think creatively and provide world-class solutions to its Fortune 1000 clients. If you don’t believe see the video of this newest facility of the 750 strong Analytics company that started in Nagpur in 2004 and that now operates across the globe with offices in Singapore, Chennai, Pune apart from this world-class development center in Nagpur. As a Nagpurean I felt proud looking at this office; if you find it good, do share with your friends. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc2k9J6rYPs&feature=youtu.be

Hey everyone!

I've been working in the food space for the last 7 years. Trained as a chef & started my own business shortly after. Now run a few small pizza shops in Mumbai. We also supply frozen pizzas B2B.

There are a few challenges / pain points I experience & would definitely like to do something about it. 
Is this the right place to share my ideas to validate & then get further advice from experience folks on how to execute?

Cheers
Varun

[31/05/18, 4:52:12 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): BBM CREATED what no brand ever could, which was short lived and climbed on by WhatsApp with only numbers than pins, thereby collecting each human with a NUMBER than a email id.

Martin ka angreji na aisa hai ki usne 3 decades mein pura global communication industry ko badal diya.

Martin uncle IS NOT YOUR MANAGEMENT GUY, he is also not a millennial. His aganecies help clients grow :). Basically growth hackers dungeon.
[31/05/18, 5:13:49 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Who is Martin?

[31/05/18, 5:19:20 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Stay updated to the communication giants/holding companies :) they have abilities to shape global narratives :) and advertising money. Hence what's popular :).
[31/05/18, 5:22:30 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Speaking of narratives, what is you take in 59seconds.com?
[31/05/18, 5:22:36 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): You haven't told me if you watched his last 3year keynote lectures and how he explains his work to grow WPP. And trends he is investing in and treats he believes in.
[31/05/18, 5:24:41 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Saw it on LinkedIn, haven't really explored, spoke to him once on how Singapore is a good place to be :). 

Some how I believe there is a LOT to be done in here :)
[31/05/18, 5:25:30 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Will definitely check it out. And see what they are upto :).
[31/05/18, 5:25:45 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Great

[31/05/18, 5:33:14 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Chillax be, if I had a nickel Everytime I recommend someone and they watched it, I would be a VC :).

[31/05/18, 5:33:45 PM] Ameet (pushstart): I loved it... U atleast checked.
[31/05/18, 5:34:17 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Have met many who just recommend n never bothered about if right or wrong followed or not
[31/05/18, 5:34:22 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Don't worry he quit his company too :P 😂😜 cause it was TOO big and political and stuff.
[31/05/18, 5:34:36 PM] Ameet (pushstart): I said this in a good way... I really want to
[31/05/18, 5:34:38 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Cause it's not their job :)
[31/05/18, 5:35:00 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Yup. May be. 
But I loved your approach
[31/05/18, 5:38:08 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Guys DO NOT FORGET sir Martin sorell speaks at Zee Melt, launching his new Media venture Martin is the CFO of who went ahead and created a Communication holding company, that counted ford and P&G, and tons of BRANDS as clinents. They guy who convinced David Ogilvy :). Make sure you know that she is just a number if your OPPORTUNITY is big enough to chase. :)

Don't know if this is the right place to ask this question. @918779219493 : If you feel its not, let me knoow and I'll delete the msg.

I want to understand what are the challenges for any home owner to provide his home on rent to an office setup. Is it advisable? What are the major issues?
[31/05/18, 6:22:18 PM] Harsha MV (pushstart): PPL drilling holes in the wall 🙊
[31/05/18, 6:22:35 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Office setup, no challange. Manufacturing unit, too many of them...:).
Put this on FB if you can...:)
[31/05/18, 6:23:32 PM] Ankit (fundhound): Cooperative society can complain in BMC if the Building is approved only as residential complex. You need to have commercial complex license as Building to legally carry out businese.
[31/05/18, 6:24:06 PM] Dorik (pushstart): Well, no bachelor's allowed.
[31/05/18, 6:25:15 PM] Rahul Paari (ps): There are many startups working in a room of an apartment. 
May be one of the founder owns that house.
[31/05/18, 6:25:55 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): It depends on which place ur in ..society formation and kind of commercial activity
[31/05/18, 6:26:33 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): CA, lawyers this kind of consultancy professions are usually allowed...
[31/05/18, 6:27:22 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): However as per Maharashtra laws u need a gumastha for any commercial activity
[31/05/18, 6:50:01 PM] Abhishek Gond (91 Navi Mumbai): Its a software company. Not a manufacturing unit. So that's sorted
[31/05/18, 6:50:55 PM] Abhishek Gond (91 Navi Mumbai): Didn't come across any clause like this because you can run an office and have a separate registered address and show this as branch office only
[31/05/18, 6:52:09 PM] Abhishek Gond (91 Navi Mumbai): I agree with Rahul on this. There are many businesses running out of the residential property at first.
[31/05/18, 6:53:00 PM] Abhishek Gond (91 Navi Mumbai): But that's what I need to know. If the law prohibits anyone to run commercial office out of residential space.
[31/05/18, 6:56:59 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): No. If you own it. Or if you have an NOC from the owner.
[31/05/18, 6:57:25 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Define commercial office. Consider me running my software company from my home and in case 2 I open a good office with employees coming in

[31/05/18, 9:12:40 PM] Nabomita (pushstart): Commercial establisment is entirely different from residential property. Plus shops & establishment registration can run into problem

[31/05/18, 9:44:59 PM] Kapil Agarwal: I am sure there is No problem with the registration address of a company as a home address which is in the name of owner or on rent.
[31/05/18, 9:46:45 PM] Vikrant (pushstart): You have to pay commercial tax when you pay the property tax..
[31/05/18, 9:48:04 PM] Vikrant (pushstart): In shops and establishment dept you can show only a small part of your house as an office.. so you will have to pay commercial tax only for that area
[31/05/18, 9:49:32 PM] Kapil Agarwal: My dads textile manufacturing business has a registerer office of our old house. Just crossed checked on zaubacorp.
[31/05/18, 9:50:38 PM] Kapil Agarwal: And many such similar examples.
[31/05/18, 9:50:50 PM] Sunil Kuber (ps): Agreed.. its totally fine
[31/05/18, 9:51:21 PM] Kapil Agarwal: I am doing the same thing
[31/05/18, 10:00:28 PM] Amrik (pushstart): Office address can be a residential property. If you are using it as an actual office then shops and establishment license is required. For this licence, flat owners and Society NOC is required.

Any best bank apply for home loan ? 
Any government subsidies i should look for ? 
Any other pointers to consider  ?
[04/06/18, 8:59:07 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Few suggestions I got is I should inquire in Government bank.
I should take loan on my mother's name (0.10% subsidy on actual rate)
[04/06/18, 9:01:43 AM] Varun Shresth (pushstart): Govt banks like sbi have better rates but poor after service. I moved my home loan recently. Any query you have they make you run counter to counter. But yes rate is lowest. Senior citizen n women have even lower rates.
[04/06/18, 9:20:07 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Cool. Will check SBI for rates and all.
[04/06/18, 9:25:18 AM] Ankit (fundhound): Take property in joint names. Each owner can claim 2 Laks income tax exception on interest. But be wary of the fact each owner needs to sign when you have to sell so disputes are possible

For example, I really like the filters which Flipkart provides for Apparel shopping. Also, I hate how Jabong app is always showing me discounts before anything else.

[08/06/18, 12:55:51 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Yeah. I would suggest to go for 91Springboard because they fit into the budget and has quite a good fellow entrepreneurs in their bucket list. 

Also the advantage is that you can shift to a different location with the same plan at 91Springboard. 

Innov8 is also great place to work. WeWORK BKC is cool. I'm not sure of other places.

I have been issued a Schenegen visa that states validity from 15th June to 28th. Does it mean I need to return on 28th or is it like the start date validity meaning I can start my journey anytime during this period? The vfs office is closed in the weekend and I wanted to know.
[09/06/18, 5:52:25 PM] Amrik (pushstart): You have to leave Schengen states before or on the 28th.

[09/06/18, 6:17:13 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: You might want to recheck because that's not how it works for a US visa... For a US visa it's the date you enter.. Not the date you leave

[21/06/18, 11:04:21 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Hello Folks, Greetings of the day ! 

We often come across many groups which are classified as per their location. How would the classification as per the profession/ Interest sounds so that we could have more concrete and qualitative discussion ? And these groups gotta be irrespective of the geography. May be folks could sublet their work to their counterparts for location constraints. 

Just an idea. Do share your opinion. Both pros and cons.
[21/06/18, 11:09:15 AM] Nishchay (pushstart): 3 words that best describe an entrepreneur?
[21/06/18, 11:36:19 AM] Harshal (uberpass): We many a times require ppl from other profession as well....eg. everyone needs a CA or related queries. Hence not advisable. This way its better
[21/06/18, 12:07:02 PM] Pavan (Pushstart): Innovative prudent and risk taker
[21/06/18, 12:40:35 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Agreed mate. With due respect to your opinion. 

I'm just advising when the user base is huge. Let's suppose you are looking out for a property then would you search it on Google or Commonfloor.com or be it any other real estate website ? However we could always retain the base/main group of Pushstart. 

Google is a matrix structure which has to be sorted and compiled to your requirement. Do you agree with me ? 

Brainstorming works when everyone amongst the group is on the same page. Saw some great enthusiastic discussion in the other group yesterday and thus suggested.
[21/06/18, 12:41:25 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Consistent, Attitude and Decision Maker.
[21/06/18, 12:42:48 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Pavan, I slightly differ to your opinion. Risk taking has got to be calculated and well justified which I clearly don't see in most of the startups through an Investors point of view.
[21/06/18, 2:04:04 PM] Pavan (Pushstart): Got that Giri

[21/06/18, 6:52:48 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): This is the 8th year of the Anjani Mashelkar Inclusive Innovation Award
that had been set up in the memory of R A Mashelkar's late mother, who always persuaded him to use science and technology for the benefit of the needy- especially the poor. They have had great winners in the previous years, more information is available at- https://lnkd.in/fcSDvDi

This award presents an opportunity to spur and fuel innovation for the benefit of the most disadvantaged sections of society in order to ‘include’ them into the mainstream. It also has another equally important aim: to sensitize innovators about the problems faced by such sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.

The awardees will preferably be those who believe in not just ‘best practices’, but ‘next practices’. Most importantly, it will value solutions that represent ‘affordable excellence’, breaking the myth that ‘affordability’ and ‘excellence’ cannot go together.
As the award grows in stature and gains national recognition, it will endeavour to leverage support for the innovator from various other private and public sector organizations.

Criteria-
Only Indian organizations or persons of Indian origin are eligible to apply.
Innovators of all ages may apply.
The nominations should be for prototypes or proof of concepts which have the potential to be successful innovations. Raw ideas will not be considered.
The prototypes, products, services or business models should be original and novel.
They should provide highest quality affordable products and experiences to the resource poor people.
The innovations should substantially and positively affect the quality of life of the disadvantaged sections of society- such as the resource poor elderly people.
All applications should clearly explain the innovation, the originality of the idea, its benefit, and impact.

Well, Who doesn't like to be healthy and fit?💪 But it comes with the price and hard work.
We observed few problems like,
1. Overpriced personal trainers 💰
2. Underqualified gym trainer along with lack of attention 😞
3. The science behind a personalized meal or workout plan is not possible by an individual to knowledge and time constraints 🤯
4. Overwhelmed and confused with too many online videos/trainers/blogs etc 🤔
We would like to address this problem with help of the personal virtual assistant which is best at its job, cheaper and always with you to understand your needs 🤖

We would like you to spare few minutes to fill out the survey to understand your problems and adoption of virtual assistance for an ultimate long-term solution 😎

[22/06/18, 5:22:59 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Hello guys Harshal Shroff here, After running and exiting my operations of 18 outlets and retaining the brand of This Corn,I visited my home town(Chinchani in Palaghar district) after 8yrs of living in Mumbai, I see that not much has changed here apart from the fact that people consume more data(Due to JIO and the current data based marketing) on their phone and are slowly getting aware about "The power of internet and connected lives" it's more like electricity, which still has power cuts in many rural areas. It's been a overwhelming experience of starting up once and humbling to exit and start once again.

However, Schools and bussiness dont see the value of data connections, and even if they do.. complete connectivity becomes an issue due to unstable Network performance.

In the comming one month i am LOOKING to connect and speak with people interested to build multilingual and affordable ways to bring 4G/5G broadband and connect applications to Rural India with "wireless street level WIFI connectivity, based on renewable POWER solutions to effective ways to deliver digital access to people with incomes less than 10k/month

If you are interested or are connected to people/startups who focus on this area do help me connect, we are also looking to connect with affordable Telecom equipment manufacturers and Network infrastructure creators.

Ideally ex-employees of companies like Telenor india, Storeking,Airjaldi,Aervoyce, Wifi Dababa, Digital empowerment foundation or people in the government helping digital india movement in the RURAL areas

Currently we are preparing to build an application for applying for a CLASS A or a Unified, Virtual Network Operator (VNO) licence.

Our Aim is to build
-Robust cheap wireless street level connectivity infrastructure
-Delivering NEW experiences and products to Rural India in affordable ways
- Delivering sachet(Under 50INR) size data,learning,insurance and investment solutions.

If your a passionate problem solver and internet enthusiast and would like to contribute to the iniative, in your free time which may lead to a full blown position..feel free to join the group. Here -- https://chat.whatsapp.com/CXRDhMeMy2i2HSSzh1reUd

[23/06/18, 9:10:46 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Marketing - Help her to connect sounds reasonably fine but she would miss the actual essence of marketing into this. 

Ask her to reach out to corporates herself write them a mail to spare sometime and not offer employment or Internship. Corporate do spare some time for students and no body denies unless they are completely struck. This is the way she would get the basics of marketing right. The very essence of the marketing is to sell a product - so her resume is the product. Ask her to pitch it and If someone rejects ask them to support with a reason / clause.
[23/06/18, 9:12:08 PM] Megha Daga (pushstart): Thank you .. Sure can suggest her try this way as well.
[23/06/18, 9:12:11 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): The intention of the message is to help her in the right way to secure the best job possible and despite of the best hardships after 48 hours If she doesn't find an Internship. 

You may PM me. I'll send you some references.
[23/06/18, 9:12:39 PM] Megha Daga (pushstart): That will be great Sir !
[23/06/18, 9:16:07 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Exactly.

Decentralizaton : Opposite of Centralization./ Without a central point of control or Failure  (Basically this it's simply this ).  

Double Spending : Classical challenge of any currency system.  If I give you 10 Rs and I should not be able to give the same Rs10 to someone else. 

No central authority : Decentralization .

Replication : Just to replicate . copy 

Peer to peer model : Direct interaction / Without any intermediaries 

Unix time stamp : Assume 000000 at let's say 12:00 midnight today.  So every second from now will added in this clock taking that as reference. So it's basically stopwatch .

Epoch time : Time Period 

Consensus algorithm : An algorithm that is used by everyone in the network to verify whether a person has solved a particular puzzle correctly or not. 

POW : Proof of Work (One of the many Consensus algorithm)  

POS : Proof of Stake ( Consensus algorithm ) Read more at Plasma

Nodes : Systems connected to a network. 

Full nodes : Check FB post answer 

Partial/Light weight nodes: Same as above 

Fast sync nodes : (Check FB Post ) 

Smart contract: A computer software / piece of code that directly controls & directs digital assets. 

Immutability in Blockchain : Data cannot me chnaged once put in it. 

For all the bold terms refer the following link : 
https://blockchain.info/block/0000000000000000001dcfc791cc4f809a33501abaf54dd60340be71969d400b

Step 1- Search your flight and compare with others if needed.

Step 2- Use Coupon Codes- 
STUDENT18 
or

[29/06/18, 3:08:49 PM] Harsha MV (pushstart): If Strategy Is So Important, Why Don’t We Make Time for It?
Dorie Clark

Almost every leader wants to make more time for strategic thinking. In one survey of 10,000 senior leaders, 97% of them said that being strategic was the leadership behavior most important to their organization’s success.

And yet in another study, a full 96% of the leaders surveyed said they lacked the time for strategic thinking. Of course, we’re all oppressed with meetings and overwhelmed with emails (an average of 126 per day, according to a Radicati Group analysis).

But leaders presumably could take at least some steps to prioritize what they claim to be an imperative. What could account for such a massive misalignment between their stated goals and their actions?

One issue is the incentives put in place — often unconsciously — by companies. Even for senior professionals, there’s frequently cultural pressure to put in long hours, which researchers have discovered often serve as a proxy for both loyalty and productivity in the modern economy. Research has shown that employees who work more than 50 hours per week earn a 6% premium over their colleagues who work a more regular schedule.

Tethering yourself to your desk may help you power through more emails, but it’s rarely a recipe for innovative strategic thinking. In fact, research reveals that productivity decreases for those who work more than 50 hours per week. What seems to really power creative thinking, according to a Stanford University study, is activities such as taking a short walk, especially outside. But that behavior may well be penalized in a corporate milieu that prizes face time.

Another barrier to strategic thinking may be internal. At least in the United States, research shows, busyness is a sign of social status. As Silvia Bellezza of Columbia Business School and her colleagues put it, “By telling others that we are busy and working all the time, we are implicitly suggesting that we are sought after.” In addition to the very real demands on our schedules, then, there’s also an incentive to lean into the frenzy: It’s a marker of our professional success. Executives may therefore be subconsciously reluctant to give up the self-esteem benefits that being busy confers.

Given these pressures — both internal and external — that push us toward rote busyness and away from strategic thinking, here are three ways individual leaders can fight back and create the white space they need.

First, it’s important to remember that strategic thinking doesn’t necessarily require large amounts of time; it’s not about taking endless sabbaticals or going on leadership retreats. As productivity expert David Allen told me when I interviewed him for my book Stand Out, “You don’t need time to have a good idea, you need space…. It takes zero time to have an innovative idea or to make a decision, but if you don’t have psychic space, those things are not necessarily impossible, but they’re suboptimal.”

Even with limited time and the same amount of responsibilities, it’s far easier to think strategically if you can clear the decks by doing simple things such as writing down all of your outstanding tasks in one place, so you can properly triage them and aren’t constantly interrupted by the feeling that you forgot something.

Second, it’s useful to be clear on where your time is actually going. Earlier this year I undertook a time tracking experiment, in which I logged how I spent every half hour over the course of a month. It’s not the easiest project to keep up (we’re used to living our lives, not recording them), but the resulting data was invaluable in terms of helping me understand exactly where and how I was spending my time. It’s quite possible there are tasks you could combine, defer, or outsource to help buy you an extra two hours per week — more than enough to step outside the daily hurly-burly and enter into the flow state of considering big-picture strategy.

Finally, once we’re aware of the implicit “busy = important” frame in our culture, it can become easier to let go of it and adopt another frame that’s more conducive to deep strategic thinking. One alternative view, espoused by Derek Sivers, an entrepreneur and author, is that “busy is what happens when you’re at the mercy of someone else’s schedule.”

By extension, one might argue, true status comes from having the discretion to opt out of the frenzy. As Sivers shared in one podcast interview, “I find it funny when people preface their emails saying, ‘I know you must be incredibly busy,’ and I always shock them by going, ‘No, I’m not busy’…. It’s like, ‘No, I don’t have to do anything for anyone, so I don’t do anything I don’t want to do…I’ve got time.” By changing the way we think about busyness — from a marker of status to a mark of servitude — it may become easier to say no to the parade of endless obligations (from catch-up calls to informational interviews) that skitter across our desks every day.

The responsibilities placed upon us are unlikely to diminish anytime soon. In fact, as we ascend in our careers — and as global competition further increases — it’s almost certain we’ll be expected to do more and produce more. Without a concerted effort, it’d be easy for strategy — yet again — to slip to the bottom of the to-do list, despite our protestations about its importance.

By becoming aware of the disincentives to make time for strategy — and taking proactive steps to embed strategic thinking into your life and professional schedule — you can stand up for a goal that you, and 97% of other leaders, recognize as critical.

[30/06/18, 9:23:35 AM] Hitesh (Social Samosa): [Long Read] - Invite for Social Samosa's LIVE Conference

The team at Social Samosa is excited to pay a tribute to the medium which is a driving factor for the evolution, existence and sustenance of quite a lot of Brands, Agencies, Publishers, Platforms, and Creators!

When we set out to recreate the #SMLive Magic this year, I was told 8 Million People and 2 Lac+ Video Views were possible in 2017 and it's a tough nut to crack considering the friendly NewsFeed algorithm.

As ambitious as it may sound, riding high in the faith and power of our community of Marketers, Agency Professionals, Creators, and Practitioner we are all set to take the challenge and breach the circles of virality with #SMLive2018

We plan to kick-start the day with a Keynote Address from one of the pioneers in Indian Advertising and Marketing Industry - Mr. Ashish Bhasin

Taking the baton from him C-Suite Advisor and Power Influencer - Tanvi Gautam will take us through the essentials of Building an Authentic Personal Brand on Social Media

Anoushka Adya, Rashi Ray and Mounica Tata DoodleODrama will discuss on how Social Media has emerged as a great tool to enable Women Empowerment

This is just the beginning; next up we have Kainaz Karmakar  and Harshad Rajadhyaksha from the team which managed to win Ogilvy India's first CANNES Grand Prix for Creative Effectiveness this year with Savlon Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks. They will speak about the LITTLE they know about Great Advertising!

A lot has been spoken about the various applications of Data across, Ashish Tiwari will share a different perspective on Data-Driven Storytelling to craft the right message

Chandramohan Mehra from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will bring in the flavor of Hyper Current and Topical Content with anecdotes from their collaboration with Dabbu The Dancer aka The Dancing Uncle

Threading thoughts from being responsive and customer-centric at all points in time, Vineet Singh will share Quick Social CRM Hacks to win over audiences

Mr. Bean from the Indian Digital Industry, Nitin Bhatia will enunciate the importance and relevance of Data in the value chain

Shifting Gear towards some Creator Tales, Ranveer Allahbadia - The Beer Biceps will share his story on carving a niche amongst the content clutter

The Master Storyteller behind some of the most engaging original content from Kingfisher, Sandeep Balan will draw parallels between Branded Content and Original Content

Over the past few years, Wittyfeed has become one of the largest Viral Content Companies and Parveen Singhal will share Growth Hacking Lessons in the process of building this new age company

Nidhi Bisht and Sarjita Jain from India's Leading Women Content Channel will sum up the #SMLive2018 show with a talk on Creating Entertainment for Women with Brands

That's the amazing lineup we have been talking about ever since we launched the initiative this year; as we strive to raise the bar and make this BIGGER & BETTER we are counting on your support to make this happen!

Come and join us to Celebrate #WorldSocialMedia Day

- Show Interest/Attendance to the event here bit.ly/SMLive2018

[08/07/18, 12:19:17 PM] Rushabh (ps): અભ્યાસપૂર્ણ આલેખન:-

Must read....for those who love equity and 
for those who hate equity.....

▪Film actor Rajesh Khanna bought a bungalow in iconic Carter Road in Mumbai for Rs.3.5 lakhs in 1970. His heirs sold it recently for Rs.85 crores. The property has multiplied by 2428 times or an annualized return of 19.38% over 44 years. 

▪Samudhra Mahal in Mumbai is another expensive property. A flat purchased in 1970 at Rs.700 per sq.ft was sold at Rs.1,18,000 per sq.ft in 2013. Money multiplied by 168 times in 43 years. This works out to an annualized return of 12.66% 

▪In 1963, Godrej paid Rs.1 lakh to buy his first house, a 2916 sq.feet apartment at Usha Kiran, Carmicheal road, in tony South Mumbai. In 2011 he sold it for Rs.25 crore. Money multiplied by 2500 times over 48 years or an annualized return of 17.70% 

▪In Dalal Street, Mumbai a sq.feet was Rs.100 in 1980. After 34 years, it sells at Rs.27,000 per sq.ft. Money multiplied by 270 times in 33 years. This works out to an annualized return of 17.90%. 

▪The first three properties can be bought and owned by cream or elite of the society who are worth at least tens of crores, mostly hundreds of crores. 

▪The last property in Dalal street; your father could have bought with whatever money available at his disposal. You can buy it even now. Your son or daughter would be able to buy it even 20 years down the line. 

▪The last property is Sensex. A sq.feet is a metaphor for one unit. If dividend yield is also included (assuming 2% CAGR), Sensex would have delivered 20% annualized returns over last 34 years, higher than the most expensive prime properties in the country. 

Good mutual funds and many stocks have delivered returns far superior to Sensex itself. 

Power of equity is least understood in this country.

If you can withstand notional loss (if you don’t book) in portfolio during bear markets, not worry about daily price movements, it is possible to make much better money than what can be made out of best of real estate. 

Give at least the same importance to equity as you give to real estate. 

You don’t mind holding real estate for 20 or 30 years. Please do the same for equity ignoring bull and bear markets, notional profits and losses. 

Many of you have been investing for last couple of years. Stay the course for at least another 15 to 20 years completely ignoring market fluctuations. You would be amazed at the fortune created for your retirement or to pass on to your children.

Guys can anybody help me to find ready available solution for below problem statement
....office automation  
Letter comes to office it should be scanned and the same first goes to boss there after he will mark it to concern officer ...then it is supposed to go to that office and there after furher down sections.....it should be traced where it is who is taking action on it....status of the letter action done or not......
If anybody knows any ready available solution please PM me.

It has to be implemented on LAN.
[08/07/18, 10:41:11 PM] Urmil (Pushstart): Not sure of existing solution but a barcode on the letter and tracking software should do it

[08/07/18, 10:50:06 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): The solution would be similar to any team management system. It could be an added feature, similar to how performance appraisal is rated by R1, R2 and those authorised can view at what stage of the process it is at.

How much generally do startups pay to recruitment consultants to hire for some profile??

Want to know the market rates??

Any standard or it depends on the deal??
[10/07/18, 1:29:23 AM] Amit Jhunjhunwala (pushstart): 1 month salary 
OR
8.33% of Annual CTC

[10/07/18, 3:42:27 PM] Neeraj Tiwari (ps): Yes.
[10/07/18, 3:44:26 PM] Neeraj Tiwari (ps): So we charge inteset annually. The thing is that these guys have cash profile more than a bank profile,however with our app we are able to streamline them and in past 100s of vendors have gone into proper bank profile.

They have to pay to agencies every week but they dont able to collect the fund in 45-60 days so always there is a gap. And we will fill that with Paperloan and with technology of Paper King.

[14/07/18, 7:32:02 PM] Karmesh(pushstart): Good one..👍🏽 spent years in the ximb campus..hence a special connection..
[14/07/18, 10:40:05 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Any brand experts here..a few months back we started a Pillow and cushion brand by the name Decor Decor ( yes 2 times decor) ..we are in about 30-40 shops around Mumbai and have just started creating a name for us..now most shops call us Decor rather than Decor Decor and we are trying to build a brand so getting called the right name is imp...we are thinking about changing the name since we are still early..should we do that?
[14/07/18, 10:42:23 PM] George (pushstart): Add a slogan to your company name. "It's not decor, it's decor decor "
[14/07/18, 10:42:43 PM] Shreya Ranpriya (pushstart): Rather to change you can  do some marketing/Branding strategies that people would love to sing a rytham or something like that.

I'm not expert but this my thoughts only.
[14/07/18, 10:43:04 PM] Shreya Ranpriya (pushstart): Yes you can do like that.
[14/07/18, 10:44:00 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Out bags and labels are Decor Decor ..but since shop keepers call it decor..we think they say the same name to the customers too
[14/07/18, 10:44:07 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): There is no right of wrong answer. If it's a serious issue, then it makes sense to change at this stage.  However I'm not sure how much marketing you've invested in. The right communication plan can help fix this
[14/07/18, 10:44:16 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Why Decor 2 times ?
[14/07/18, 10:44:39 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): @919662915070 any inputs?
[14/07/18, 10:44:41 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): We have a slogan..Happy sleeping, Happy dreaming :)
[14/07/18, 10:45:03 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): I think people are lazy to say same name twice and that too same name
[14/07/18, 10:45:27 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): lets connect
[14/07/18, 10:45:54 PM] George (pushstart): Based on the law of least effort, people won't say decor decor unless you make something like a music out of it 🕵‍♀
[14/07/18, 10:45:59 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): It's decor decor bi*ch
This should be your tag line :3
Millennials and hipsters will be all over it
[14/07/18, 10:45:59 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): We have bags, labels and other stuff of that name..we are thinking once we run out of that..we will change the name..we can't change the company name from Decor Decor since out GST name, back account is all in that name..but change the pillow brand name
[14/07/18, 10:47:13 PM] George (pushstart): Find a rhyming chant with decor decor
[14/07/18, 10:47:18 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): It just seemed snazzy then..lol..we didn't think much.. probably weren't too serious at the start..but have started get a good response now  so want to do the right things now
[14/07/18, 10:49:42 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): ohk ohk so i think decor decor can be kept and used as a brand name
[14/07/18, 10:49:51 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): the issue is making people call it decor decor
[14/07/18, 10:52:22 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Yeah making shop owners call it decor decor..we correct them all the time..but I don't think that is working
[14/07/18, 10:52:33 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): and if you are planning to change, its a cumbersome task of brand building
[14/07/18, 10:53:13 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): We don't have a brand yet..we don't have any online presence..just a small offline business
[14/07/18, 10:53:15 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): brand names are promoted using reinforcement methods
[14/07/18, 10:53:44 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): still reprinting all collateral, etc is not easy
[14/07/18, 10:55:12 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Ya..it makes sense to make the shift. It's difficult to get people to repeat a word for a brand name. You however need to ensure the transition happens smoothly so that you can piggy back on any brand equity that you may have already built
[14/07/18, 10:56:32 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): if it was me, would have rebranded to decor as people comfortable with it... unless there are trade mark issues etc... keep things simple... time spent in correcting shop owners can be used for some other productive discussions too ;)
[14/07/18, 10:57:14 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): decor wont work cos its a generic name
[14/07/18, 10:57:32 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Yes we will.mentioned decor decor since that is the company name and then a name for the pillow ..like Gillette Mach 3..in our case decor decor will be written small but prominent
[14/07/18, 10:58:14 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): but how will you ensure they call it the new name
[14/07/18, 10:58:39 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): If it's a simple name..they will call it..what else will they call the pillow
[14/07/18, 10:58:57 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Good. It's absolutely ok to have a brand name different from a company name
[14/07/18, 10:59:03 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): decor
[14/07/18, 10:59:59 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Yeah but the name on the bag will be different..like hypnos..so they will call it that in from of the customer
[14/07/18, 11:00:19 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): hmm
[14/07/18, 11:00:26 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): hope you can re enforce that
‎[14/07/18, 11:01:02 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): ‎image omitted
[14/07/18, 11:01:14 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Our current design also doesn't help..since it just seems the work decor is mentioned twice
[14/07/18, 11:01:45 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): you need a lot of work on branding my friend
[14/07/18, 11:01:48 PM] Vasishta Cary (pushstart): honestly
[14/07/18, 11:01:48 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Develop a couple of options and do a market test...it'll help you in your decision making process to arrive at the new name. Seems like an effort but saves a lot of pain later
[14/07/18, 11:03:10 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Yes..thanks guys..proper branding efforts will come.later..currently operations are driving us crazy..
[14/07/18, 11:03:19 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Appreciate the quick help

Need more of such please.

Can someone guide me on whether .net is better or .in?
[17/07/18, 8:21:01 AM] Kyle (pushstart): Privacy - .In is public by government policy so your WHOIS will be visible (domain ownership details)
[17/07/18, 8:21:33 AM] Kyle (pushstart): .Net is kind of old school so if you're a public brand it might make you look a little bland
[17/07/18, 8:23:29 AM] Kyle (pushstart): But it's a top level domain which means it's stable, not controled by a specific country and not likely you'll ever lose it.

[24/07/18, 9:21:13 AM] Amit Jhunjhunwala (pushstart): For all budding / struggling Entrepreneurs 

Things go wrong as they sometimes will

When the road you're trudging seems all up hill.

When the funds are low and the debts are high
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh.

When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
Life is strange with its twists and turns
As every one of us sometimes learns
And many a failure comes about
When he might have won had he stuck it out;
Don't give up though the pace seems slow—
You may succeed with another blow.
Success is failure turned inside out—

The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell just how close you are,
It may be near when it seems so far;

So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit. 
*Happy Morning*

[26/07/18, 4:14:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: By Shabia Walia, founder of Wild Earth ❤
[26/07/18, 4:17:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Wild Earth' was born out of Shabia's fears of what she put on her baby's body after she became a mother. The labels scared her and the fact that she did not understand what went into the products made her uncomfortable. Being the solution driven person she is, Shabia started making soaps and lotions in her own kitchen. Soon word spread and mothers were demanding her to make the full range. Her experiments proved to be a huge hit with everyone and soon she was forced to move from her kitchen to a proper office and workshop. Today Shabia is proud to have created a brand that provides natural quality products which young, old and babies can use without any fear of side effects of harsh chemicals.

'Wild Earth' today sells online, thru retail stores, is a huge gifting opting for corporates and is exported to quite a few foreign countries, purely on the basis of its quality and the pure intention behind the brand, an intention that was born from a mothers heart and not in a business school.

Not satisfied by her own achievements, Shabia also wanted to share her share of blessings with those who are not so blessed or loved. And again with this intention of giving back, 'The Bluebells Community' was formed.

When Shabia is not rustling up stories or spreading smiles with her social initiative 'The Bluebells Community', she loves to whip up a storm in the kitchen cooking or design new products for 'Wild Earth'. Shabia lives in Mumbai with her cinematographer husband Ravi, 8 year old daughter Sia and dreams of her daughter growing up in a world with no boundaries or borders.

Shabia is also the winner of the 'Rex Karmveer Chakra Award' (2015-16, 2016-17) Women of excellence Award 2016' 'Top 50 Rising Stars Award 2016', & 'Digital Women Achievers Award 2017', 'ICICI Advantage Woman Award' & the 'Women of Influence Award' by I Inspire 2018 for her exceptional work in her profession and the field of social work.

Our first Product Launch+AMA on Pushstart by founder of Wild Earth. 

Ask her anything and everything related to her journey and brand Wild Earth <3 <3 

Shabia Ravi Walia, Founder and Owner of 'Wild Earth' is a media professional for the past 24 years.﻿ 

'Wild Earth' was born out of Shabia's fears of what she put on her baby's body after she became a mother. 

The labels scared her and the fact that she did not understand what went into the products made her uncomfortable. 

Being the solution driven person she is, Shabia started making soaps and lotions in her own kitchen.  

Soon word spread and mothers were demanding her to make the full range. Her experiments proved to be a huge hit with everyone and soon she was forced to move from her kitchen to a proper office and workshop

Today Shabia is proud to have created a brand that provides natural quality products which young, old and babies can use without any fear of side effects of harsh chemicals.

'Wild Earth' today sells online, thru retail stores, is a huge gifting opting for corporates and is exported to quite a few foreign countries, purely on the basis of its quality and the pure intention behind the brand, an intention that was born from a mothers heart and not in a business school.

Is your Aadhar card linked to your phone number? (Y/N)

Does your phone book have a contact named *UIDAI* with number 1800-300-1947 saved in it suddenly? (Y/N)
[03/08/18, 4:47:35 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): Checked just now.

I have
[03/08/18, 4:47:43 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): Whats that ??
[03/08/18, 4:48:16 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Me too
[03/08/18, 4:49:00 PM] Sumit Gilitwala (pushstart): Not sure why it is there suddenly. The official Aadhar Twitter says it's an hold helpline which is not functioning since 2 years. 

That's why classified the poll in 2 parts - is your Aadhar linked to the phone or not.
[03/08/18, 4:52:35 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): How did they get it on everyone's phones though? 

Telecom carriers?
[03/08/18, 4:53:07 PM] Gaurav (pushstart): Following
[03/08/18, 4:53:36 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Yes
[03/08/18, 4:53:53 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Yes I think so
[03/08/18, 4:54:29 PM] Sumit Gilitwala (pushstart): Possible. But it's an old helpline which is not functional since 2 years. Why would the telecom operators do that? Is that an error at a national scale or a phone numbers data breach at a national level?
‎[03/08/18, 4:54:46 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): ‎image omitted
[03/08/18, 4:56:06 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): UIDAI added that "some vested interest are trying to create unwarranted confusion in the public. UIDAI’s valid Toll free number is 1947 which is functional for more than the last two years," and that it has neither asked "telecom service providers or mobile manufacturers or Android to include 18003001947 or 1947 in the default list of public service numbers".

Holy fuck. Is this a hack?
[03/08/18, 4:57:26 PM] Sumit Gilitwala (pushstart): 😆 even if it is the UIDAI won't accept it. 🤣
[03/08/18, 4:57:44 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Gosh. I clearly don't own my phone anymore
[03/08/18, 4:58:01 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Amen.
[03/08/18, 4:58:02 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Any ios users also facing this problem?
[03/08/18, 4:58:27 PM] Jeet (pushstart): No
[03/08/18, 4:58:30 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Ios doesnt have it
[03/08/18, 4:59:19 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Infact my one not aadhar linked phone also has it(anoroid)
@919769713664
[03/08/18, 5:00:23 PM] Sumit Gilitwala (pushstart): Surprised. 

Thanks for the response. Will build a list of hypothesis and share with the group later on.
[03/08/18, 5:01:13 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Well if operators pushed it then it should be in my sim contacts, but it is in my phone contacts 😶
[03/08/18, 5:01:32 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Please check
[03/08/18, 5:01:40 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): But UIDAI just has the DB of numbers right?

Whoever has put it on people's phones, must have required access to either Telecom operators or the operating system
[03/08/18, 5:02:04 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Go to contact settings and check only sim contacts

[03/08/18, 5:02:42 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): if it's only an android phenomenon, then basically android owns contacts.. someone hacked android? and put it in the name of UIDAI ?
[03/08/18, 5:02:48 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Just checked

Phone contacts
[03/08/18, 5:03:28 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Only anoroid phones
[03/08/18, 5:03:32 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Have this issue.
[03/08/18, 5:03:45 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Ios phones do not have this issue.
[03/08/18, 5:04:01 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Another reason to buy iphone😂😂
[03/08/18, 5:04:09 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): 😂
[03/08/18, 5:04:36 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Is it some vulnerability in android phones?
Even phones recent security patches have this number
[03/08/18, 5:06:10 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): i hear that ios users also have it, if they have synced their contacts to google.
[03/08/18, 5:06:24 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Not as such an android issue, but google contacts.
[03/08/18, 5:07:22 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Ya..its come via Google contacts
[03/08/18, 5:08:07 PM] Vinayak deshpande (pushstart): Yes
[03/08/18, 5:08:27 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): That number is saved in my phone contacts and is not there in my google contacts

[03/08/18, 5:10:19 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): New 4G sim. The sim phonebook has some contacts pre loaded in it. EVERY sim had it...since the time of BPL or modi telestra....this is not new :)
[03/08/18, 5:10:49 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): It's the god damm Sim contacts that has it 😂
[03/08/18, 5:11:41 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): The problem is, it is not in my sim contacts 🙂
[03/08/18, 5:11:58 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): .
[03/08/18, 5:13:03 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Phone contacts.
[03/08/18, 5:13:57 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): When you choose to sync your contacts you consented to the same being "synced" as is. Wheater on phone or Sim on the clouds, which then gets linked to your Google/apple/live id.
[03/08/18, 5:14:26 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Comes back as the contacts linked to accounts
[03/08/18, 5:15:16 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): .

[03/08/18, 8:02:46 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): This isn't regarding the login password, i needed help to hide the wifi password, which is visible in network sharing center
[03/08/18, 8:08:21 PM] Kapil Agarwal: I got something. Pming you.
[03/08/18, 8:51:31 PM] Sumit Gilitwala (pushstart): This has happened with multiple people without any uniform trend of Aadhar linked or not / mAadhar app installed or not / android or iOS / etc.

Possible ways it got saved on everyone's contact list with my comments below:
1) Govt did using the Aadhar linkage with phone nos - null hypothesis - ruled out as per the UIDAI statement
2) Paytm - it has read and write access - ruled out with a belief that they have no business use case for doing so. They would have come up with a statement till now and must have done the right no and not the old one.
3) WhatsApp - no business use case for them 
4) Telecom operators - possibility, but they would have saved on the sim card and not on the phone 
5) Operating systems - no biz use case of android and iOS 
6) Google through Gmail contacts - possible use case - they save multiple helpline nos for better user experience - they have read write access on your Google contacts which are synced on phonebook. 

Anyone who has their contacts synced on with Google but didn't faced this? 
PS: iOS users can also sync contacts with Google and they saw this thing happen.

[04/08/18, 1:05:17 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Ios wale jhuth bol rahe hai.

Its not possible to get ios number or may be they had anoroid and shifted to ios recently
[04/08/18, 1:11:51 AM] Vinayak deshpande (pushstart): No I have ios since 2015 Aur Aadhar Maine link karaya in 2017
[04/08/18, 1:12:18 AM] Vinayak deshpande (pushstart): Even I had that no. In my contact and I deleted asap
[04/08/18, 1:15:48 AM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Google added that number in 2014, so maybe that number was synced with google contacts and so u have thag number in your contacts list. 

Its funny how it took us almost 3 years to realize that we have an unknown number in our contact list 🤣🤣
[04/08/18, 1:19:10 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Yes irony

[04/08/18, 10:51:05 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Google is playing with people’s phone
[04/08/18, 12:03:58 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): A quick search on 112 reveals that it was implemented in India in 2016. But it has been around internationally much before. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)
[04/08/18, 12:04:27 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): remains mystery though
[04/08/18, 12:12:27 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): @919167781943 if you look in this code then u can see that here, they are specifically checking for country code "in". I know 112 has been around internationally much before, but why will google add that number in Indian smartphones if that number was not even announced in India in 2014.

🤔
[04/08/18, 12:28:25 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): true, they could have added it, as it's a default standard emergency no. but questions still, why insert only 2 numbers then. this pic is not given by google though. Anyway i think we can wait for couple of days, by then media will give all answers 😅

AMA: All of us have constant questions about the deep (dark?) world of VC funding or investments in general across different levels (Seed to Growth). 

Today, as discussed with Neeraj Joshi, I am doing an AMA to answer any of your queries in and around this topic. 

About me: I have been a global investor and a serial entrepreneur, with multiple successful exits and investments across countries, using my roles as founder of a VC firm while being Advisor to a number of others. 

I take pride in building multi-million dollar companies, Great Manager Institute being the recent one. I run quite a few companies in different geographies. 

I am NOT an expert. I am just a learner and a perennial student. 

Follow the link to become part of the AMA.

Andrew NG is the guy who worked at Google and now works at Baidu and build Coursera on the way.

AI talent is basically algorithm writing. Which is as subjective as an ad campagin insight finding

[15/08/18, 6:55:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi All! Posting on behalf of The Goa Project (TGP).

The Goa Project is an annual “unconference” that brings together a diverse set of people from various fields – to converse, collaborate and co-create. The entire agenda is crowdsourced, leading to two exciting days of talks, workshops, presentations, pitches and interventions. Run completely by volunteers who are passionate about cross-sector learning, collaboration and ideas.

The sixth edition of TGP will happen on the 26-27th of Oct at a secret location that's NOT Goa! Yes you heard that right. We're also launching a week long (19-25th Oct, 2018) fully-funded TGP Residency where business owners, makers, thinkers, do-ers will be matched with inter-disciplinary collaborators bringing in an opportunity for both venture owners & collaborators to work on innovative solutions! 

This is where you come in! TGP is looking to reach out to exceptional venture-owners who will bring interesting flavors to the residency (they're also looking to find equally interesting collaborators, but more on that on a later date) and for this, included below are the application and more information links. We urge you to apply right away (deadline is 18th Aug), if you know someone who could benefit from this too, do spread the word to them as well!

Application link:  https://goo.gl/forms/ebqciZ1NTJf3oasZ2
More details on the residency: http://www.thegoaproject.com/eligibility-criteria/ 
FAQs: http://www.thegoaproject.com/faqs/ 

If you think you'd make an awesome volunteer instead, apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/ZpBmUvsQYv4IGQ8F2 

Appreciate the help!
Thanks!

[16/08/18, 9:01:35 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): Anyone who is into client acquisition, would agree that it really is a tough nut to crack. Most of us don't even like pitching because it is so unpredictable while being one of the most vital aspects of any business.

What if I tell you that most of the people do suck at pitching because of one, very simple evolutionary phenomenon?

What if I tell you that there is still a way in which you can overcome this. Well, it's all in the MIND!🧠🧠🧠

You will be fascinated by unraveling how different things are  from what we ASSUME.

Read on to dive deeper into understanding how the evolution has made pitching so complex and how we do have a way to use Psychology for turning the tables into our favour.

[17/08/18, 11:12:54 AM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): *#DoForKerala*

GOD'S OWN COUNTRY IS IN DISTRESS!

Help Kerala government and people with this initiative!

People like you and me have been evacuated from their houses in Kerala due to excessive flooding. This is THE BIGGEST FLOOD in Kerala's recent history. AND MANY WHO ARE NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO IT, DO NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. 

Many are stranded. They need us. They wait in isolated islands of land with water pushing in faster with every minute - waiting for rescue. But if we don't act now, they'll just be waiting for tragedy.

Many lives lost, 50000 plus families displaced, losses of Rs 8000 crore upwards!

Here's how you can contribute to #DoForKerala

*Please set up the above image as your display picture.*

*1. Update your whatsapp profile picture (dp)*
*2. Update your facebook profile picture (dp)*
*3. Put it as a whatsapp status message every day for the next 1 week*

Following are the objectives of our campaign.

a.Get aggressive coverage by national and international media on #KeralaFloods so that we can get more help.
b.Get more donations from various governments, corporates and other national and international organizations.
c.Get more donations from everyone who cares about Kerala nationally and globally
d.Get organizations to sponsor life boats, rafts, 4 wheel drive jeeps or tractors and helicopter for rescue operations.

Here's the official Govt. Site for Donation. https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in 

*Forward it to all your friends, relatives, all Whatsapp groups and Facebook and urge everyone to change their profile picture to this one for the next one week.*

[18/08/18, 5:20:36 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Can we use it on our laptop/desktop too?
[18/08/18, 5:24:19 PM] Rajat Jain (pushstart): No. Currently, we have launched in mobile only :)
[18/08/18, 5:24:27 PM] Rajat Jain (pushstart): Yeah. Sure :)
[18/08/18, 5:25:14 PM] Sayan Ganguly: I generally use any platform for writing on my laptop only. Please do work on that if you plan to.
[18/08/18, 5:27:39 PM] Rajat Jain (pushstart): Sure!
[18/08/18, 5:36:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Golden words
[18/08/18, 5:39:28 PM] Karmesh(pushstart): Yes..laptop preferred for writing
[18/08/18, 6:05:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: It’s a 90-9-1 rule. 90% lurk, 9% contribute time to time, 1% account for most contribution. The ones contributing generally prefer laptop over mobile. As your tg are the 10%, dekstop Verizon is a must. @917879111222
[18/08/18, 6:06:07 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Or may be such app wasnt created wherein ppl can write on mobile flawlessly
[18/08/18, 6:07:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hmmmm. Nope 👎. Typing on desktop cannot be replace by mobile for now. I cannot imagine to write my content on mobile
[18/08/18, 6:07:27 PM] Sunil Kuber (ps): Agreed.. Hardcore writers will prefer Desktop..
[18/08/18, 6:07:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *replaced
[18/08/18, 6:08:32 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Why cant you imagine?
Just trying to understand why mobile is big deterrent to writers?
[18/08/18, 6:09:02 PM] Sunil Kuber (ps): @917879111222 - yours is a good product.. created a sample story .. few feedbacks.. shall share later..
[18/08/18, 6:09:57 PM] Rajat Jain (pushstart): Our app is not based in text-based content, hence we have gone mobile first.

 However, good thoughts @918779219493 . We definitely shall look into it.
[18/08/18, 6:11:07 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Are you same guys who use to conduct webinars?

[18/08/18, 6:17:16 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Liked the product. But at times i felt the same as of using instagram.
[18/08/18, 6:18:14 PM] Rajat Jain (pushstart): To draw a parallel, you can say we are trying to create instagram for LinkedIn in a sense :)
[18/08/18, 6:19:15 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Great product. Liked it
[18/08/18, 6:41:58 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: I have a question to @918779219493 and folks who write content regularly . How many of you use the feature of "Speech to Text" on  Mobile ?🤔🤔

 I find it most easiest way to type long post. 
You can basically write content while you are lying down on your bed or just roaming around in taxi. .. Google Speech to text is awesome.
[18/08/18, 6:45:07 PM] Arjun (pushstart): Wow never tried this
[18/08/18, 6:46:04 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): google board speech to text sucks
[18/08/18, 6:46:06 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): not that good
[18/08/18, 6:46:47 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: I just typed this message using Google speech to text and I did not have any problem
[18/08/18, 6:47:26 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): my voice sucks maybe :3
[18/08/18, 6:48:08 PM] Sunil Kuber (ps): 🤣🤣🤣
[18/08/18, 6:49:09 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): i dont understand why the voice recognition of google assistant is better than speech to text? why cant they use tthe same module for speech to text?/
[18/08/18, 6:50:37 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: Do you have any proof that suggest they don't use it?? I guess it's your hypothesis maybe true maybe not 😬
[18/08/18, 6:52:30 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): i have used both
[18/08/18, 6:52:45 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): used same sentence
[18/08/18, 6:53:03 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): google assistant understood even hindi words
[18/08/18, 6:53:07 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): board didnt
[18/08/18, 6:56:31 PM] Nabomita (pushstart): Same here 🙋‍♀
[18/08/18, 6:58:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Bro haven’t used it till now But I think I should start using it from today I will share my experience around one week from now
[18/08/18, 6:59:11 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: 👍🏻👍🏻
[18/08/18, 6:59:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: By the way typed this message With the help of speech to text
[18/08/18, 7:00:46 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: 😬 it's fun
[18/08/18, 7:00:59 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Speech to text and voice assistant integrated would be next level thing 🙌🏻🙌🏻
[18/08/18, 7:01:28 PM] Nabomita (pushstart): Focus ! Mobile holds attention for a shorter span of time, which is why conversations happen better in here. It is an excellent device for transactional communication. Writing needs us to think deeper as we type.

[18/08/18, 8:05:21 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Yeah, Amazon Alexa and Google home #connectdevice
[18/08/18, 8:17:16 PM] Mittal Patel (pushstart): I tried speech to text before few weeks but it didn't work well because google stops listening as soon as you pause speaking. Then had to switch on the mic again. That irritated me a lot. Obviously there would be many pauses and gaps while speaking. Any app or work around you can suggest to make it work?
[18/08/18, 8:24:11 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): How comfortable it is? Is then any app which improves user experience?
[18/08/18, 8:24:34 PM] Mittal Patel (pushstart): I tried couple of applications but wasn't very happy with them.
[18/08/18, 8:25:01 PM] Mittal Patel (pushstart): Currently I use Google Keep and use speech-to-text in it to note down things.
[18/08/18, 8:25:16 PM] Mittal Patel (pushstart): But again, it stops frequently so not very useful
[18/08/18, 8:25:37 PM] Mittal Patel (pushstart): I would like to use it while driving car, where I will speak whenever I had any idea and it will keep making notes.
[18/08/18, 8:27:12 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): I assume every voice assistant will have invoke command. Like Google will have ok Google etc
[18/08/18, 8:27:51 PM] Mittal Patel (pushstart): Yeah
[18/08/18, 8:34:49 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Guys, we you want some customised features then you can guys can let me know. I can build dedicated app(obviously in background I will Google only) but I can try to improve user experience. For e.g you have two notes i e A and B. If you want you can say please save this to note A.
[18/08/18, 8:35:00 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): If you*
[18/08/18, 8:35:19 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Use Google*
[18/08/18, 8:36:36 PM] George (pushstart): Holy shit. I made such an app in 2014 . You can search for speakyourupdates in Amazon.com
[18/08/18, 8:36:44 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): I do that!
[18/08/18, 8:41:49 PM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): I use speech to text to type out entire mails and save it to drafts. Then proof read it and correct the typos before sending it. Saves alot of effort in general.
The problem for using it to write content is the time required for thought processing. If i have things ready in my mind, then its easier, but thats not how content writing works. It involves a lot of writing, proof reading, rewriting etc!
The mobile screens are not good enough to show entire content at a glance and editing the content is a pain..
Thats why laptop/desktop!
[18/08/18, 9:08:07 PM] Ankit (fundhound): I need the regional content writers
[18/08/18, 9:08:47 PM] Sunil Kuber (ps): Pm..lets connect

[18/08/18, 11:24:47 PM] Saurabh Mhase (pushstart): I think for us kind of startups, we don't have much data to deal with.

And I guess digital marketing is also over glorified..content marketing growth hacking bhi sabko pata hai..

[18/08/18, 11:41:22 PM] Shraddha (pushstart): Even we tried a lot, but couldn't succeed. And so i said you don't get. We also raised this in front of CM and he said some provision would be made in policy.

Hi friends,

I have so far conducted more than 40 interviews with women from 20 or so countries for my book on women's global empowerment.

For my next set of interviews, I would like to talk with women who have experiences (good or bad) of women helping women, in the form of, for example, sponsorships, mentorships, networking, job referrals, survivor support groups, entrepreneurship training programs, and financial self-help groups. For the sake of diversity, I am particularly interested in interviewing women who are not from the United States.

If you have any suggestions, send me a message here on Facebook or email me at simon.hedlin@post.harvard.edu

I am thinking to organize an informal workshop wherein we discuss the opportunities & challenges in paid media marketing for startups & small & medium companies.
 Some of the Questions which will be covered:
- Which channel is the apt channel to advertise?
- At what stage should we do paid ads?
- what objectives to choose per channel to get maximum results
- how do we get ROI on our spends, Etc.
I will organize this informal event if I have interest from 10-15 people. 15 people max so that we can understand everyone's business problem clearly. Do say 'Aye' if you are interested & will decide the place & time. 

Thanks,
Saajan Jain

[27/08/18, 5:58:53 PM] AAkash Khatri (pushstart): It's a social app and different from what you've seen in the market (said every founder ever :p) . The major loss any food tech app suffers is with delivery and logistics. We have through the help of AI really optimized our algorithms such that our costs have reduced by over 40% and which has also reduced the delivery time for customers. That's just the tip of our business model though :)
[27/08/18, 5:59:15 PM] AAkash Khatri (pushstart): Thanks so much buddy! I'll definitely text you.
[27/08/18, 5:59:31 PM] AAkash Khatri (pushstart): Thanks a ton!

[29/08/18, 11:41:38 AM] Varun Sheth: #pushhelp

Hello Good People,

Looking for advice on starting off my Hospitality Marketplace project. 
My preference is to proceed with a technical co-founder & not do this solo, especially considering that I am not from a tech background. 

What are the salary ranges for a CTO? Not necessarily looking at a very senior person. Is it advisable to go down a route of offering a salary + equity? 

Happy to hear any sort of feedback & connects.

Cheers
Varun
[29/08/18, 11:48:07 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): Salary plus equity is recommended. But release the equity in tranches
[29/08/18, 11:49:39 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Following
[29/08/18, 11:51:51 AM] Sagar (Pushstart): Angellist has a tool that shows you the average salaries and equity ranges for different personnel split by geography and industry. That's pretty comprehensive.
[29/08/18, 11:53:05 AM] Varun Sheth: Thanks Shraddha
[29/08/18, 11:53:18 AM] Varun Sheth: Going to check this out. Thanks.

[29/08/18, 12:14:56 PM] Varun Sheth: ok thanks

any sources where I could scout for a CTO?
[29/08/18, 12:33:51 PM] Sagar (Pushstart): There might not be a defined role but you can select specific functions that person will be expected to perform. Plus there's a little more to finding a co-founder. Your vision needs to align, you've gotta be able to work with each other. There will always be room for negotiation.

[03/09/18, 10:34:22 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Good morning Pushstarters. This is Akshay Kenkre. From today we are starting a specialised vertical for start-ups. Finance as an area is often the most critical piece of business and start ups often lack support in this area. We intend to fill the gap by handholding various start ups by mentoring, advising, working towards effective taxes and compliance. This would help you to clear due diligences and would enable a start up to be structured while seeking funds. We also have a strong M&A arm, which could help you navigate through your M&A times. We are not a PE or a fund but a trabsaction enabler. Investors do not look only at the idea, but also the viability of the execution of idea in a structured form. In case you have any questions, shoot an email to akshaykenkre@transprice.in or ping me on my number. Have a great week ahead.

[04/09/18, 10:46:56 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Hey People ,

Consulting does not mean the consultant that person is just charging high for few words ..it mean it is charging for its expertise for its hard core experience in which s/he has put lots of effort in term money knowledge and time and other resources
[04/09/18, 10:47:11 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): True
[04/09/18, 10:47:16 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): It can be karmesh
[04/09/18, 10:48:06 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): Before the admin tells me to take the discussion to fb i will stop. But consulting is business  and not startup.

[04/09/18, 10:59:11 AM] Nagraj (ps): 🙏🏻🙏🏻
[04/09/18, 10:59:47 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): I do consulting with high charges bcoz the quality services I deliver can't match  or compare as it comes after years of experience and my personal research . .

I remember my last job CEO told me one sentence when I argue that I am unable to sell our products (high end products of USA in india) as my prospects later customer in India told me that it is costly it won't possible you or company to survive in Indian market .

CEO reply *the quality product/services always comes on high value* .

You can't compare Merc with Maruti. 

Hence I end my word here .

*Belief system people work everywhere.*
[04/09/18, 11:02:10 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Calling something a startup is just a fancy name for business. How does it matter what u call it?
[04/09/18, 11:03:51 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): If it really matters, then startups have been closely linked with disruptive innovation. Keeping that as a criteria, most of the startups will fall out.
[04/09/18, 11:04:24 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): People , 

50 year back people were still doing biz in India and across world but there was not any governing bodies like ROC does that mean biz or Start up can we define only as a registered firm .

Biz or start up mean two things to me 

People and money .
[04/09/18, 11:05:58 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): And why is that sir? Whats so different about them?
[04/09/18, 11:06:22 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): Even the GoI uses monetary scale and time frames to define a startup.
[04/09/18, 11:06:41 AM] Prathmesh Baheti (pushstart): I dont see why it matters
[04/09/18, 11:07:02 AM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): everyone left
[04/09/18, 12:06:06 PM] Rohit Mahind (ps): Friends.....That definition is used only for DIPP recognition...(6k + startups are DIPP recognised so far) ...That's given to enjoy the benefits like tax holiday for 3 years and all...

Does NOT mean others are not startups.

[06/09/18, 11:06:00 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): Cool
[06/09/18, 11:06:15 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Quality standards will be very low.
[06/09/18, 11:06:22 AM] Shraddha (pushstart): 😑
[06/09/18, 11:06:59 AM] Jeet (pushstart): Umm not actually.
This work is very basic. 
Just adding slides in fromt and at back and minor sound improvisation.
[06/09/18, 11:07:30 AM] Jeet (pushstart): In case of 6-7K you get full explaner video this days that too high quality.
[06/09/18, 11:08:04 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): When they she says editing, I'm assuming multiple shots need to be cut and transitioned together. Am I right @919769323046?

[06/09/18, 6:49:25 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Hi Shraddha, length of final video is never a criteria for cost of video editing. 

It’s the ratio of the raw footages : final cut that matters. 

In your case it seems like it’s a easy ratio and not much footages to play with. 

And for the graphics part like titles additions and all,  depends on how classy you want that or if you are okay with amateurish design of text, Colors etc. 

From your requirement I feel 2-5k would do. 
If there are more of footages to see and edit and then add text n animations, maybbe around 10- 15k.
[06/09/18, 6:51:24 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Sounds interesting. Would like to meet some if you could put me in touch with, Jeet.

[14/09/18, 8:37:11 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: ❗Warning serious question and long post ahead ❗

 *Case 1:* 
Day before yesterday   few guys were caught smoking weed in my campus (BITS Pilani , Pilani Campus) .....
One of them next day refused to open the door and security guards & students had to destroy the ventilation duct to get inside and found him sitting in a corner and crying... People with whom he was found were all previously caught for the same ...

Not only this group but there are many other batchmate of me who do smoke weed , cigarettes , drink alcohol ..etc . 

One of my other batch mate was undergoing a antidepression treatment in my 2nd year (He is from the south ) . The reason was because he did his coaching from some institute in Banglore / Hyderabad that made them study 16-18hrs compulsorily ..On daily basis...He became a machine and didn't even know why he was doing engineering.. 

There are many such examples of South Indian students who after coming to campus just ruin their lives...

 *Case 2* : 
Yesterday saw a news about an IIT Guwahati 1st year girl commit suicide and leave a note that engineering sucks. And that she was dragged into it by her parents expectations.. 


Guys I really feel that the situation is getting worse everyday .... Education has been wrongly interpreted as a forced labor .. 


So I have this question to everyone who even feels a smallest of urge to try and improve the situation .. Do you have any ideas or suggestions..??


P.S. : Couldn't share on FB because my batchmates won't like such things to be revealing (I am assuming)
[14/09/18, 8:38:17 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): i am planning to drop out too
[14/09/18, 8:38:29 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: Why I posted this question here is because we are Entrepreneurs and like solving challenges and have an open mind at problems .. Couldn't find a better place for getting reviews.

[14/09/18, 8:43:07 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): As a part of my another venture, i have been visiting colleges and interacting with final yeae students ...seems they are only interested in getting jobs..and more interested in how to crack infosys or CG or TC campus drives...there is no motivation to learn or do something different..
[14/09/18, 8:43:59 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: Exactly same situation in BITS Pilani (which I can surely say is considered to be one of the most premeier institute of India )
[14/09/18, 8:45:23 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): i am of the view that there are enough jobs but  what is lacking is talent...
[14/09/18, 8:46:20 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): they enroll for degress and ultimately end up doing courses in other insitutes ...
[14/09/18, 8:49:38 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): why i want to drop out
1)  college doesnt support your ideas and ventures, they dont ask what you are doing, or how is it going. they ask why
2) spending avg of 1 lacs per year just to get a degree in the end.
3) bare min opportunities and exposure.
4) students just want to score marks and get placed. (even mech guys think they will get jobs)
5) they spend avg of 2 lacs in 4 years on extra courses which fetch them the jobs, and people think college got them placed. the ROI factor.
[14/09/18, 8:50:48 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Well I am currently pursuing computer engineering from mumbai university and here are a few problems. 

1. 75% attendance criteria. 
2. Ton of assignments/journals which are of no use if you ask me.
3. Outdated syllabus. 
4. Outdated knowledge. 
5. Faculties who are unaware of the latest tech and industry standards of doing any job. 
Etc
[14/09/18, 8:52:00 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): I'm not from a premier institute so need some clarity on this. 

I think most students enroll or aspire to get into these institutes to score a job that has a high CTC. 

If this is the case, all they need to do is stick through the course and get fulfill their objective of getting that comfy job. 

Why do they then deviate from this rather straightforward path and end up doing courses from other institutes?
[14/09/18, 8:52:19 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): ‎This message was deleted.
[14/09/18, 8:53:16 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Other Institutes?
[14/09/18, 8:54:09 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: Fun Fact : When I approached my HOD last year explaining her the reason I don't study much of Electronics and that my passion and Research interest lies in Blockchain (Which she haven't even heard of ) ....

I got the reply that "just finish the degree and go to Standford / Harvard " ...... 
I thought to myself that if this is situation of BITS then I cannot imagine what happens in other colleges ..😔
[14/09/18, 8:55:11 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Our education system needs a serious upgrade.
[14/09/18, 8:55:53 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Damn that's rough. Well the situation in other colleges is slightly better because we don't really expect much from our college to begin with. 

The knowledge that you're on your own steps in rather early.
[14/09/18, 8:55:53 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: I think *Complete rewamp* 🤐
[14/09/18, 8:56:32 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): I just realized how depressing this is but yeah that's what it is 😂

[14/09/18, 9:01:31 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): training institutes...
[14/09/18, 9:02:30 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Also for the record reading here..weed is harmless....Anheuser-Busch the Budweiser maker, OWNs tons of Farms to make cannabeer. 

Stop considering cannabis as a DRUG. It's a herb that grows naturally. Boheco is an Indian company that does hemp research funded by the tatas.
[14/09/18, 9:03:11 PM] Vineet (pushstart): Our attitude needs upgrade which will help the educational institute to upgrade.. There are social and economic pressure which has to be faced by everyone.. This thing will take two generation to change.. Its one step at a time to create symbiotic environment.. It cannot be a blame game situation..
[14/09/18, 9:03:12 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): Oh. Well a degree ia of no use now. We have to do these courses and update ourselves else u will stand no where in thia competitive world. 
This is true especially in the IT sector.
[14/09/18, 9:03:20 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): also..students are not at 100% fault...the syllabus is the culprit....
I never used derivatives or trignometry or integrations or chemical formula etc etc in my entire 14+ yrs career..
[14/09/18, 9:05:36 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): instead of Bachelors in Information Technology..why cant we have Diploma in software testing or Diploma/degree in Python Programing or cyber security or such...very specific courses ...enabling a right career choice and more concentrated efforts..
[14/09/18, 9:05:43 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): That's called ignorance and also a product of the education system. 

The phone you use to the animated movie you see...all of which has derivatives,trino and integrations.

Also what career is this ?
[14/09/18, 9:06:47 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): i know these are used..but i dont want to build phones ...i want to do what i am really interested in..
[14/09/18, 9:07:01 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Which is ?
[14/09/18, 9:07:28 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): Software Testing...i have been doing it for 15 yrs now..
[14/09/18, 9:08:07 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Vocation training is good too.
[14/09/18, 9:08:25 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): That's why India has ITIs
[14/09/18, 9:08:59 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): "The education system" is run by people and with a different attitude.
[14/09/18, 9:09:47 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Probably watch 3 idiots. Or Khan academy for some time, also Stanford and MIT have online lectures. 

Ekalavya India mein hi tha.

[14/09/18, 9:15:19 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): @919560124225 not everyone is bold enuf to take the risk of dropping out😜
[14/09/18, 9:25:50 PM] Vaibhav Nanda (pushstart): Still trying to convince my parents lol, I have exam on monday

[19/09/18, 7:48:19 PM] Jeet (pushstart): I think it is flawed model. UC always needs to look for newer markets to acquire.
[19/09/18, 7:50:58 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): That's almost every service bussiness nothing flawed with it.
[19/09/18, 7:53:58 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Flaw which is i am talking about is : lets say i am
Plumber 
Registered on UC
I made certain clients and i tell them i will come and do work at lower rate.

Win win for customer and plumber. 

UC loses market as more and more market is aware of UC.
[19/09/18, 7:55:46 PM] Jeet (pushstart): @919960058547 i dont think this flaw is with every service startup based out there.
[19/09/18, 8:08:23 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): That's the plumber undercutting his own value. Also someone who is a comfortable player or a old person NOT a young one, who wants to actually make a legit career as a plumber.

Also that's human, like how you NEED drivers to drive card before we have autonomous cars. 

Every EXPERIENCED service start-up knows that growth always comes from a NEW market. 

Information arrbitrage is a thing. Short termism doesn't work in service. 

Watch more of Martin sorell for his views on how to build a service bussiness.
[19/09/18, 8:19:28 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Plumber carpenter
Electrician
Ac service guys
Cleaning guys

From politics to blood mafia everyone is making it a commercial activity and innocent lives are damaged in this blood lust.. 

A few years ago, a few friends and myself worked on something to solve this problem and were faced with similar threats. Thanks to pushstart, ive met alot of people who have tried to do something similar and are still doing things in their personal capacity to solve this problem. 

I am seeking to connect to all such people who have tried solving this problems, through technology, NGOs or any other means!

Planning to unite them all and do something to have a huge impact. Pls DM me if you have the zeal, the passion and have tried solving this problem or tag someone you know who might be willing to collaborate and make this big!

Pushstart can do this!

I am reaching out because we (my friends) are looking for someone to take on some of our embedded tech needs as the guy we have can't dedicate enough hours to finish in our needed timeline.  An overview and some details are below. The timeline is EXTREMELY tight at this point so looking for a small miracle.



Below is a brief intro on Vessel and overview of project needs.

Vessel Works is a non-profit and social impact venture that has innovated a solution to the paper cup problem. 58-billion paper cups are landfilled annually in the US alone; this is 158 million paper cups every day. At Vessel, we combine a library style service with sophisticated tracking technology in order to eliminate the need for paper and plastic to-go cups as well as provide quantified-self information to consumers regarding the impact of their everyday choices.


More details over Email.

Deadline of project completion is 28th September.

Send me your email id.

[06/10/18, 6:24:41 PM] Hasan Sunara (pushstart): Hi Pushstarters, Any  Visa consultants here? 
 
I am Hasan Sunasara from Ahmedabad, a Software Consultant.

I am on a mission to make a Visa consultant's life easy. So far, I have identified some of the problem areas and implemented a solution for:

1. Apply Visa - Capture candidate's details and documents online
2. Generate Embassy Form - Auto filled embassy form in PDF format
3. Check Visa Status
4. Receive payment online
5. Email notifications

I am currently working on an important and a bigger challenge of making an integration with the embassy systems such as making an application, appointment booking etc. so that a Consultant's system remains a single point of contact for a candidate.

Would you like to contribute by giving your views on the above and any other challenges you face in your daily activities?

If it's feasible to converse, please let me know your suited time to talk/communicate/chat for a few minutes. Thanks.

Appreciate any reference. Please DM.

2 Questions :-

1) Any body has lost their money in banks by making a fixed deposit ? For example the banks closed due to fraud ?

2) If yes or even no, any possibilities to get that money back ? Any lawyer or expert in our group who can take this as challenge and opportunity to solve the matter. 

Suggestions and guidance are welcome

Thanks.

I advise 3 Singapore based ICOs and my company is personally running a Token Sale raise out of Malta, I would say the legislation in Malta is clearer. Problem with Singapore remains that Bank accounts are an issue- there are workarounds (creative incorporation/separating the entity issuing tokens etc) but Malta's Agribank seems to be pretty good with accounts- the wait is significant though- somewhere around 3 months.

[11/10/18, 9:54:38 AM] Sumit Gilitwala (pushstart): If you check the history of people losing deposit money due to bank shut down in India, the last time it happened was sometime in 1960s due to a small local newspaper publishing an unverified news which created nation wide run-through to banks. 

Post that there wasn't any incident when people lost deposit due to banking fraud. 

This is only about India I'm referring to.

Just wanted to thank Neeraj for sharing Chirag and Ami’s references immediately when I asked if anyone was in 91 yesterday. 
Luckily Chirag was available. 
Had a really good time discussing about his company Milo. 

It was a college activity given to us to get a job in a company for a day. 
After unsuccessful attempts with marketing executives of Inorbit mall, I had come to 91 with some hope. And with pushstart it was accelerated super fast and got the task done. 
Did some research for few hrs and came up with some ideas for branding with some execution plans, presented it to the team and got a video testimonial from them. 
Thanks a lot Chirag and team Milo for the prompt response and helping out with an open mind. 😊
[16/10/18, 6:23:44 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Pehle he pushstart kar lete 😜

[16/10/18, 6:25:25 PM] Abodid (pushstart): Actually I wanted to give a try with unknown places. But it was really difficult there to suddenly penetrate into their teams for a short time. 
The corporate professionals have an insecurity which I understand is normal though.
[16/10/18, 6:26:19 PM] Abodid (pushstart): True that. He is. Had a good time.. and lots of coffee 😜
[16/10/18, 8:08:44 PM] Chirag Dodiya (pushstart): It was wonderful to have you with us buddy and thanks for amazing ideas @919439094370. Stay in touch and lets keep growing with Pushstart.

[23/10/18, 3:05:28 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): Hello, hope you guys are doing great 😊

I'm looking for 2 good graphic designers (who can also do adaptations and artworks as well) to work with me on a regular basis. 

Ideally
- Having 5+ years of experience
- Adept with design softwares like PS, AI , CDR
- Consistent, detail oriented and reliable since all deliverables are deadline based

The individual will work from home and therefore needs to be someone with experience who does not need babysitting since I don't like micromanaging 🙈

Prefer someone who freelances full-time and can eventually move to a retainer model.

[23/10/18, 6:42:45 PM] George (pushstart): This is a new currency and payment network built by ex-PayPal guys, called Initiative Q. The Q currency is currently being allocated for free if you are invited by an existing member.
The idea is that if millions of people join, Q could become a leading payment network, and, according to well-known economic models, that means the value of the reward would be around $130,000.
The amount you reserve decreases every day, and each member has a limited number of invites. You can use my invite link here:

[30/10/18, 1:59:29 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): 😍
[30/10/18, 2:11:43 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Many celebrities have now a days become investors as they know their celebrity status will go off one day but the returns on money is sure to come..
[30/10/18, 2:12:19 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Best example: Ashton Kutcher
[30/10/18, 2:12:53 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Kutcher is actively involved in product development activities too. He is one a kind
[30/10/18, 2:13:31 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Many actors and actresses like jacqueline fernandez 😏
[30/10/18, 2:13:38 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Has anyone ever heard of cherian media or how the times internet invests ? It's usally equity for reach :) and a cash component.
[30/10/18, 2:13:50 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Oh she's investing too? Wow
[30/10/18, 2:15:28 PM] Sagar (Pushstart): Push Meetup bro
[30/10/18, 2:16:03 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Yeah now many people are doing it when they are at their peak so that the past doesn’t repeat and in the past many such great actors have fallen into debt after their career starts to slide
[30/10/18, 2:16:06 PM] Neeraj Joshi: 🤣
[30/10/18, 2:16:11 PM] Abhijit Oothaman (pushstart): So, what happens is: These celebrities making investment is almost never financial. They get paid for their name.

Startup will get coverage in terms of these celeb's name - free PR and a credible name to back them. Celebs get some equity, and hope the start-up goes successful.
[30/10/18, 2:16:31 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I wouldn’t agree completely
[30/10/18, 2:16:57 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): jacqueline fernandez invested 3.5cr in raw pressery
[30/10/18, 2:17:12 PM] Abhijit Oothaman (pushstart): Exactly. You want to know the difference between an actual financial deal and a free-PR stunt - try to find out: what amount did these celebs put in.
[30/10/18, 2:17:35 PM] Abhijit Oothaman (pushstart): The one's with the funding amount public are viable, other's not so much.
[30/10/18, 2:19:30 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Some people go with goodwill but if you see that’s also a money Thing kinda.. Now a days not much celebrity are entertained with just name to be honest.. startup’s or even existing round investors ask for cash rather than just brand ambassador as ambassadors can always be bought
[30/10/18, 2:22:19 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I personally believe that.. if you don’t pump money.. you never bother to take interest in a company which affects it in a long term.. saw many such examples and also personally where I had to fire my co founder
[30/10/18, 2:25:10 PM] Abhijit Oothaman (pushstart): Take Priyanka Chopra's investment in dating-app  Bumble app as a barter system.

The start-up leveraged her name (and they are about to leverage some more, when the app launches in India soon) and she probably got some equity in return.
[30/10/18, 2:26:12 PM] Abhijit Oothaman (pushstart): I am not sure, but try researching what amount did she put in this 'investment' otherwise?

Most probably, that number won't be public.
[30/10/18, 2:33:32 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Yeah amount is hidden.. but she has put up investment for sure because her first company where she invested.. she closed the round of 8.2 million $ funding means she has put some money in that round in first company but I don’t think she has said exact amount in both startup’s which says that she hasn’t put only name but also cash
[30/10/18, 2:49:25 PM] Abhijit Oothaman (pushstart): Same goes for every celebrity-investment deal, if their investment amount ain't public, then there's more to the story.
[30/10/18, 3:14:18 PM] Dk: Any connect with Atomberg Technologies ? Or Similar Hardware Startups ?

[01/11/18, 10:37:06 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Hey People , 

May i know who are using *Instamojo* ?

I am facing some issue , as in  -Since there is limit upto 10K for receiving paymentthereafter we need to upload KYC to increase the limit to use their Payment Gateway.

There are asking for Certificate of Proprietorship which is not possible because there is no such Governing Body for Sole Proprietors.

Any Contact Detail ( Apart from Email ID ) - i mean middle mgmt or customer care head no . wherein i can talk with them regarding the same.

Cheers,
Nirav
[01/11/18, 10:38:41 AM] Vinay Jain (pushstart): You can instead use Paytm merchant or PayU.

[01/11/18, 10:43:14 AM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): U have to give shop and establishment license for sole proprietor...its also called gumasta
[01/11/18, 10:44:53 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Nayan - now the rule has come - if u have more than 20 employee then only u should apply Gumasta License
[01/11/18, 10:45:30 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Thanks Ankit - will speak to her
[01/11/18, 10:47:07 AM] Neeraj Joshi: We are planning to organise #PushQuizs on pushstart fb channel. There would be one winner for each quiz we organise. Anyone would like to be a gift sponsor for the initiative? Ping me for more details.
[01/11/18, 10:47:51 AM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): Ease of doing business lol
[01/11/18, 10:53:38 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): yes nayan , but even one go to BMC for Gumasta - there will always ask for 2-6 month business detail then only they will issue licence apart from license they ask for bribe for visit commercial gala/shop - thereafter only one can get GST (  based on Shop and Establishment Act Certificate ) and hence after obtaining GST and Gumasta - *Bank* will allow us to open Current A/C. ( *I am saying from my previous experience when i started my one pharma venture*)

In short - the Entreprenuers ki to lag jati hai - therefore people start giving Bribe & appoint Agent to avoid all those hassels to physically get licensing.
[01/11/18, 10:54:47 AM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): i belive agar khilane se kaam hota hai toh nothing wrong, at the end of the day getting work done matters...😉
[01/11/18, 10:57:14 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): yes that is the mindset ...bcoz we all has limited time and can't spend 24-48 hours meeting those stupid Babu of Government - Last week i went for Food License cost 100/- when i met officer to approve the application he ask straight away for *25,000/-* bribe to get instant licence on Saturday..

Ab bata bhai 100/- ka license k liye one has to pay 25K

[01/11/18, 2:59:45 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hi Pushstarters, congratulations on building together a thriving startup community in India. I have been a part of Pushstart for quite some time now and have seen numerous launches of some great products and have scooped brains behind those products. 

I am a product marketing manager for a small but fast growing B2E business. We have a product that we have been using internally for sometime now to streamline the devops process within the organisation and it has been quite fruitful for us. We plan to launch it for other people in the community to get them started with devops quickly and intuitively. But for that I need some feedback from you guys.

Just some questions to understand your team’s pain points and overall outlook at the devops process within your organisation.

If you build, manage and deploy release pipelines within your organisation, or anything remotely associated with devops. I would love to hear you out and ask you a few questions.

Here’s the link to reach me out on Whatsapp: http://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=918527464661

Neeraj this side, the one who started Pushstart! 

We have come a long way from being an idea discussion platform to a community which helps you to grow your business. 

We are planning a few interesting things for the community. 

But before implementing them I would like to understand the current problems that you as pushstarters are facing and what can be done to solve them. 

Over this weekend I am planning to meet the maximum possible pushstarters to gain insights and feedback on the existing version of ps. 

If you can spare 30 mins of your time tomorrow or day after tomorrow, I would love to meet you over coffee. 

Do ping me if you would like to help and grow this community further.

[06/11/18, 12:37:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Happy Diwali to you ALL! 
In this auspicious occasion, we would like to #PushLaunch *PushConnect*! 
*Why PushConnect?*
The most common FEEDBACK after personally interacting with 150+ Pushstarters in the last 1 month was: 
You guys are doing an amazing job online but do start some initiative which will increase the OFFLINE engagement between pushstarters. 

It will lead to more Collaborations, Partnerships, and Conversions for pushstarters! 

And here we are launching PUSHCONNECT! 

Will share more details tonight! Stay Tuned!
[06/11/18, 12:38:12 PM] Saajan Jain (pushstart): Nice 👍
‎[06/11/18, 12:38:18 PM] Neeraj Joshi: ‎GIF omitted
[06/11/18, 12:38:45 PM] Saajan Jain (pushstart): Haha

[06/11/18, 12:57:02 PM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Can we plan on weekends?
[06/11/18, 12:57:50 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I don’t see a difference between a weekend and a working day for a founder
[06/11/18, 1:00:02 PM] Ashwini Nair (pushstart): So true.
[06/11/18, 1:01:10 PM] Madhuri Sen (pushstart): Loads of difference in traffic certainly 😁!
[06/11/18, 1:01:43 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Haha 😆
[06/11/18, 1:15:47 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Inclusive of traffic 1.30 pm to 7.30 pm on a Tuesday, statistically the most productive day of the day 😉 . Plus customer meetings mostly happen on weekdays. If it's weekday that you're planning for, try early morning if the venue is open ( 8.00 am to 10.00 am, or post 6.00pm.) TiE organizes some meetups early morning, have attended couple of them, also BNI does early morning meetings starts 7.30 am i guess.
[06/11/18, 1:20:27 PM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Currently a management student so weekends is the only days I’ve to invest for my startup
[06/11/18, 3:01:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Oh ok
[06/11/18, 3:02:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Early morning is out of question sirji but yes can think about after 6 sessions. This time bear with us. Will take care of this from next time

Looking forward to some leads on the same.

[06/11/18, 6:10:32 PM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Just to create the awareness about what is coming up. 
Because that is how I believe will bring people to the solution what is designed and being delivered.

But if initial some videos are required I believe we can wait.
[06/11/18, 6:27:40 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): You would have to pay if you are new and want publications to cover you..
[06/11/18, 6:30:40 PM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Ah! 
I shall wait for the word of mouth awareness for now then. 

Thanks for highlighting this :)

[08/11/18, 11:42:29 AM] Utsav (Pushstart): *need help regarding founders agreement*

Hi,
I am Utsav from U-Farm, agritech company working towards distributed urban farming.

I am the sole founder of the company having spent 14 months full time on this. We have 3 employees.
Now, a good friend of mine is interested in joining the start-up and I too am looking for a co-founder. 

We have received multiple grants, we have a paying pilot customer and a product ready. 

Now with all this in mind. I do not know how to give equity to a co-founder who is not there from the beginning. Once he joins we will put in equal amount of funds into the company. 
How does one calculate this? Or guess this?
[08/11/18, 11:43:09 AM] Utsav (Pushstart): The stage of U-Farm is pilot stage/seed stage.
[08/11/18, 11:44:12 AM] Utsav (Pushstart): Like we have the product ready 70%, we have found a product-market fit and there are paying customers Willing to take our product and service.

[08/11/18, 11:46:56 AM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Share some responsibilities with co founder into which he is having expertise ..wherein you don't need to guide him for its operation work .

[10/11/18, 9:54:23 PM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Apne group me he number pada tha😋
[10/11/18, 9:54:30 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Woah, big name.. will try to reach him via LinkedIn first.. 😅
[10/11/18, 9:54:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Also it is very difficult to reach out to deep directly.
[10/11/18, 9:54:37 PM] Sankara (pushstart): 😂😂
[10/11/18, 9:55:09 PM] Neeraj Joshi: He is crazily big bhai log 😄
[10/11/18, 9:55:45 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Yup, totally get that..
[10/11/18, 9:55:55 PM] Abodid (pushstart): True that. 😅😅
[10/11/18, 9:56:02 PM] Sankara (pushstart): That's the reason wanted to see if someone could give the referral..
[10/11/18, 9:56:06 PM] Neeraj Joshi: He won’t reply bhai. @919952925688
[10/11/18, 9:56:23 PM] Neeraj Joshi: And someone won’t waste their referral for a case study bhai 😜
[10/11/18, 9:57:00 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Or research paper
[10/11/18, 9:57:06 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Jo bhi hai
[10/11/18, 9:57:10 PM] Sankara (pushstart): I totally understand, but worth a shot though..
[10/11/18, 9:57:12 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I don't think so. Ppl actively take part in these things if the study suits them
[10/11/18, 9:57:31 PM] Neeraj Joshi: I have had different experience then
[10/11/18, 9:57:45 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Its just about *approach* and *communication.*
[10/11/18, 9:58:08 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Nope. Many a times it is about priorities and time for them bro
[10/11/18, 9:58:21 PM] Sankara (pushstart): One of the reasons why I was checking for founding/leadership team..
[10/11/18, 9:59:17 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Because time that the organization shares is going to be extremely crucial for this study..
[10/11/18, 9:59:56 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Again as I say. Approach and communication. 

Approach through right person & channel

And communicate the values which they are interested in. 

Talking to Nikesh Arora wasn't difficult on personal level. As both were correct but got blocked by GS Global Head on wrongly communicated aims.
[10/11/18, 10:00:22 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Few folks shy away but many do respond.
[10/11/18, 10:00:36 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Approach or communication bhi Sahi hai but if time he nahi hai toh?
[10/11/18, 10:01:53 PM] Neeraj Joshi: These guys have their calendar planned for months bro
[10/11/18, 10:02:06 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Does that mean he or she is dismissing you?

Its not about then not giving value.

Or also about your proposed value is yet not lucrative to them. (By lucrative I don't just mean name)
[10/11/18, 10:02:21 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Chill.. mostly it's been about priorities and if the requests match their interests..
[10/11/18, 10:02:28 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes
[10/11/18, 10:02:49 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): AMA ke liye i won't comment. But baaki cheez ke liye i have had good mentors like Amit Ranjan from slide share..


Thus i won't discourage folks.
[10/11/18, 10:03:04 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Let it be!
[10/11/18, 10:03:17 PM] Sankara (pushstart): And if fortunately my message/approach reaches them in the right time and mood, then nothing like it..
[10/11/18, 10:04:07 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Even if they can't spend personal time, they'll direct us towards someone who can guide us, if the work is of some benefit to them as well..
[10/11/18, 10:04:38 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Patience and good communication is still the base essence. And yes- networking also matters.
[10/11/18, 10:05:09 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Amen to this..
[10/11/18, 10:05:20 PM] Sankara (pushstart): Stick to the basics..
[10/11/18, 10:22:18 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): Nice discussion. Sankara, good luck! Keep us posted once you crack it 👍

At ConnectPlus, we believe in the power of cold pitches (be it email, call, Linkedin, etc) for that meeting or time for call with who ever it is concerned, if we strongly believe that we have a value prop *for the other person.*
[10/11/18, 10:22:51 PM] Dhanyal Gopi (pushstart): btw Any platforms for finding folks who are looking for jobs in startups, apart from angel.co, hasjob, linkedin and pushtalent?

[11/11/18, 12:51:49 AM] ‪+1 (415) 910‑4392‬: Even though the description is a little vague, it seems like a platform to connect with youth who are doing good in society.

They have competition rounds after you apply for this. Winner gets cash price 50,000/- and free mentorship for 1 year.
[11/11/18, 12:52:04 AM] ‪+1 (415) 910‑4392‬: Hope it is helpful for some startups and entrepreneurs.
[11/11/18, 1:11:22 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Agreed. Approach and communication is what we call as modern articulation which we are least interested in.

Entrepreneurs use jargons which are far beyond a person's wavelength and most of them drop here. 

No english bakar and formalities. More simple it is, more effective.
[11/11/18, 11:15:35 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Edugild is looking for edtech companies with valuation upto $1.5-2M to pitch for funding. They have to be leveraging technology for education.  Interested can mail me on rishi@edugild.com

If many folks are interested I can put together an expert team for delivering such a 1-2 day workshop (Cold calling, cold emails, LinkedIn outreach/personal branding - Nikhil Jain, Holistic presentation skills as an entrepreneur) in Mumbai.

[13/11/18, 2:14:24 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Bro not audible
[13/11/18, 2:14:41 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Bounced off within 10s
[13/11/18, 2:15:01 AM] Neeraj Joshi: 99% people would do what I just did
[13/11/18, 2:15:33 AM] Abodid (pushstart): Same here. Audio was not audible
[13/11/18, 2:17:39 AM] Neeraj Joshi: @919176827699 is still watching I think :P
[13/11/18, 2:19:38 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Who's keerti shah?

Click the link. 🤣
[13/11/18, 2:21:12 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I was listening to the video.. seen 

She is in my network only... Didn't know her before this video
[13/11/18, 2:21:24 AM] Neeraj Joshi: Ok
[13/11/18, 2:22:34 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Good attempt but clarity in content delivery is missing. Use a mic. 

Its difficult to hear. And then that intro music can be softened next time.
[13/11/18, 2:29:40 AM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): Would have been better if video was short and crisp. Plus showing few examples of art of resume writing. But overall good effort 👍🏻
[13/11/18, 2:32:13 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): ‎This message was deleted.
[13/11/18, 2:32:54 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I can help you. (If only, you need it)

As with my previous venture into Editing Papers and Resume and Coverletters to SOPs now. I have had experience of reviewing almost 1000 Resume and countless LinkedIn profile Editing.
[13/11/18, 6:39:32 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): I agree there’s little audio issue.
The reason it got so low because we tried to reduce the background noise and unfortunately along with that even the conversation part audio too get such low.🙈

This video also turned out to be a lesson for us and we partnered with 91springboard
[13/11/18, 6:39:49 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Hopefully future videos will not be having that issue :)
[13/11/18, 6:40:31 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): I thank each one of you for the constructive feedback :)
[13/11/18, 6:40:38 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): We can surely connect
[13/11/18, 6:41:24 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Noise cancellors use kiya tha kya ?
[13/11/18, 6:43:00 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Audacity kiya wo bhi first time try kiya tha
[13/11/18, 6:44:02 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): If people here can help me with some good video editing and audio editing app which is a crack version 
Let’s meet up.
[13/11/18, 6:49:13 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Mic was used but as I said above the audio of the content also got low somehow 🙈

Working on it and we are confident that future videos will be better
[13/11/18, 6:49:43 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Only 2 videos (including this one) will be little disappointing
[13/11/18, 7:52:59 AM] Neeraj Tiwari (ps): All is good. When we start this happens always, but will surely not when you will be doing your 1000th video. Keep doing it. Overall good effort, learn, fix, make more videos. Good to see you taking feedbacks positively.
[13/11/18, 8:19:40 AM] Hamza (hamXtalks): Thank you for those motivating words @919850196443 :)

[14/11/18, 6:44:11 PM] Urmil (Pushstart): I guess you would “check in” into their system from your source and they will send it to your destination location instead of the airlines doing so. 
Works great when you have extra baggage...the cost for over the limit baggage is much higher at the airport. 

@919324565617 correct me if it is different

Is it legal to deliver alcohol via delivery startup?
I know back in 2015, GOI had made it legal to allow people order it at home, but unsure. 

If so, anyone already into this space?
[15/11/18, 8:06:28 PM] Shashank Shekhar (Pushstart): Dunzo and all other similar startups have banned it

[15/11/18, 8:09:45 PM] ‪+91 95795 95956‬: Seller, delivery person & receiver should all have permits. :p

[15/11/18, 8:11:29 PM] Hitesh Atwaney (pushstart): There was an article before Diwali about how this is going to be made legal soon to curb drink and driving - and also enhance employment opportunities
[15/11/18, 8:13:24 PM] ‪+91 95795 95956‬: To store liquor at a residence, yes. Most shops don't enforce this, but with delivery there are bound to be more issues wrt the authorities.
[15/11/18, 8:15:45 PM] Urmil (Pushstart): Storing liquor permit applies even if you go and buy it, so this should be in place already but unheard of
[15/11/18, 8:19:30 PM] ‪+91 95795 95956‬: Agree.
[15/11/18, 8:25:44 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Hello urmil

I'm an advisor at cloudbar. We've recently forayed into online delivery of liquor. 

Hipbar has been extensively doing this since last couple of years and have raised about 30-35 crores from Diageo. 

There is a license that you might require which is popularly known as LMDP (last minute delivery partner) license just like we used to have shop establishment and F&B license. 

Maharashtra is likely to also start its operations in early 2019 and karnataka has already taken a move. 

Spent close to 15 days, brainstormed with players on both the ends. Happy to answer any further queries.
[15/11/18, 8:25:50 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): There is a particular limit to what sort of liquor and ceiling limit to the same. 

However this is not enforceable a lot because at any given point of time you can place an additional storage request at excise office or their website.
[15/11/18, 8:26:08 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Paid news tha. 😜
[15/11/18, 8:26:47 PM] ‪+91 95795 95956‬: For a residential place, carrying permit is enough.
[15/11/18, 8:28:17 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Not above the ceiling limit. That is why people place permissions during new year parties and any other occasions.

[20/11/18, 3:32:20 PM] Varun Sheth: 70k

[20/11/18, 3:33:03 PM] Varun Sheth: genuine is she forgot to cancel prior to free trial expiring
[20/11/18, 3:33:15 PM] Ram (pushstart): I have heard people getting refunds. Try all methods of communications. Like linkedin contact page, fb page, tagging them to post. 

Mention they have not sent you reminder email which they should have sent.

[20/11/18, 3:45:05 PM] Hitesh Atwaney (pushstart): I ran into a similar problem before.
If she hasn't received a reminder mail (about trial getting over) then you can contact support, they usually process the refund within a couple of hours, no questions asked
[20/11/18, 3:46:09 PM] ‪+34 612 47 56 09‬: What about they have sent an email and the fault is from our side ?

Do they still refund ?
[20/11/18, 3:47:09 PM] Hitesh Atwaney (pushstart): Haven't encountered that before. Basically if you ping them on your first day itself, you could say you got the mail late due to some reason. If they know you aren't using it or intend on using it, they refund the amount instantly
[20/11/18, 3:48:32 PM] Varun Sheth: She just got a message saying a refund will be processed in 5 days. 

Relief. Excellent response time from them.

[24/11/18, 7:18:24 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hello Pushstarters, 
Thanks a lot for the overwhelming response to our *Partnership* with *GMI* and *Forbes*  🔥🔥

Hopefully, Many Pushstarters will be benefited out of it! ❤ ❤ 

After Launching about our Partnership, Many Pushstarters reached out to me with a lot of Genuine Doubts. 

*Kindly read through the following FAQ to get a better understanding of the Forbes Thingy:*  

*Whats GMI?* 
Great Manager Institute is a sister concern of Great Place to Work Inc - Headquartered in San-Francisco. 

It has offices in 54 countries works with 7000+ organizations and millions of employees every year.
 
*What is this partnership all about?*
GMI will be assessing YOU and your MANAGERS via a short survey sent to all your employees once you REGISTER.

Based on this data, TOP 100 Great People Managers and TOP 50 Organizations will be awarded and featured in Forbes India. ❤❤

*Whats the Criteria for Qualification?* 
1) Any individual who has minimum 3 or more team members is eligible for individual recognition: TOP 100 Great People Managers. 

2) Any organization who has more than 50 employees and has operations in India for than 2 years is eligible for organizational recognition: TOP 50 Organizations. 

And both are not mutually exclusive, one individual can feature as well as his organization (if eligible) and vice versa. ;) ;) 

So all *Managers, Founders, Entrepreneurs with a minimum team size of 3 can APPLY*!                                                                           

*Where to Apply?*

I hope india doesn't copy it although we have the ingredients ready which is aadhar. Everything is linked to aadhar.
[26/11/18, 3:14:08 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): This is how living in china's surveillance state looks like

https://youtu.be/OQ5LnY21Hgc
[26/11/18, 3:18:19 PM] Vineet Kadam (ps): A single card linked to everything is not at all a good idea.

Imagine you do something that maybe th3 government didn't like. They will just flag your aadhar card and you can't use any service which is linked to your aadhar card. Like your bank account, sim card, etc.

[28/11/18, 1:29:18 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Why it's needed?
[28/11/18, 1:29:50 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): Why the compulsion? If I don't see value in the meetups, why should I forced?
[28/11/18, 1:29:51 PM] Neeraj Joshi: For now we have divided it in that way only: central and western, harbour and central
[28/11/18, 1:29:57 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Pls dont take it otherwise, i m not arguing... we can even talk on phone some day
[28/11/18, 1:30:26 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): *be
[28/11/18, 1:30:38 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Because the real
Value of ps is attained only when Pushstarters engage online and offline
[28/11/18, 1:30:58 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Exactly... also Push start has grown to this level that was due to curation and not coz being forceful or any compulsion
[28/11/18, 1:31:03 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): That's what you think. Why should everyone go by your assumption?
[28/11/18, 1:31:25 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hmmmmm
[28/11/18, 1:31:32 PM] Utkarsh Bangalore (pushstart): I'm just being the curious one here. Don't get me wrong please
[28/11/18, 2:02:37 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Long discussion. Lets discuss when we all meet
[28/11/18, 2:10:35 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: Bro what was your attendance in College ?? 😏😏
If low then weren't you committed ..🤐
Hope you get the point
[28/11/18, 2:13:57 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Yes I wasn’t committed for college
[28/11/18, 2:14:05 PM] Neeraj Joshi: That’s why had low attendance
[28/11/18, 2:14:11 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Wasn’t relevant for me
[28/11/18, 2:15:36 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: BITSians forcing attendance is so oxymoron 🤣

But still people attend tests... 🧐
Bring in investors to meet up. Exclusive pitching rounds only to attendees .  So much attendance you see🤐
[28/11/18, 2:16:42 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): @918779219493  If you make Push Start to Start Pushing, people will not connect. The curation has been phenomenal. Gwo these meetups to a level when people dont come they think they lost a good opportunity to connect with others, specific speakers. Curate people, create amazing content. Dont do it because it is the right thing to do. JUST do it RIGHT!!
[28/11/18, 2:16:58 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): take * these meetups
[28/11/18, 2:17:09 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Advise taken sir :)
[28/11/18, 2:17:38 PM] Saurabh: Face to face meetings help a lot, is my experience. Not sure about the mandatory part, but once in 60 days doesn't sound too taxing
[28/11/18, 2:17:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: That’s what
[28/11/18, 2:18:10 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Thanks @919820800021  🙏
[28/11/18, 2:18:25 PM] ‪+91 91675 32580‬: I would say, don’t make it compulsory, but appreciated.. everyone loves a nice meet up with food and drinks, but the main idea (in my mind) is a set of great people, easily accessible either on calls / whatsapp / Facebook, who can help you meet and connect with more people, and help each other where possible.. (some might even call it matlabi, but to each their own) it’s a great platform..
[28/11/18, 2:18:51 PM] Saurabh: You should make it a fremium model. Attend a meeting, or pay to continue in the group.  Win-win 😁
[28/11/18, 2:18:52 PM] Ameet (pushstart): Superb. Very well put
[28/11/18, 2:19:13 PM] Neeraj Joshi: We are coming up with subscription model soon
[28/11/18, 2:19:26 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Stay tuned! 🔥🔥
[28/11/18, 2:19:39 PM] Saurabh: There you go.
[28/11/18, 2:20:16 PM] Neeraj Joshi: New year will mark it’s beginning in Mumbai and Pune ☺️☺️

[28/11/18, 6:18:32 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Virtual Meetups 🤣
[28/11/18, 7:44:58 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Read the discussion ..just my two cents..Don't think this is bas..a community is for two purposes..helping and getting helped..if u would only add go where u would receive value then the community doesn't benefit from U. So why would you be included? You may not see value..but someone else may get benefitted from your presence...but yeah keeping it on Sundays would help..also dividing in zones for ease..Peace :)
[28/11/18, 7:45:29 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Don't think this is a bad idea
[28/11/18, 7:46:33 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): 😅😅😅
[28/11/18, 8:18:21 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Love u bro. Golden words
[28/11/18, 8:18:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Next time Sunday it is
[28/11/18, 8:18:47 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Then
[28/11/18, 9:11:52 PM] Pratik (Pushstart): Anyone is Hotel or hospitality industry here..? We manufacture and supply linens and Furnishings in bulk for hotels and hospitals and would love to connect if you are from.this industry :)

[01/12/18, 10:44:52 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Congrats shashank. Amazing. Splendid Go to Market strategy. 

A few queries:

1. How did uber benefit out of this since you also used their resources ? Was it brought to their notice prior to use ? Legal compliances checked ? 

2. Can you also think of more innovative models of the entire process being executed ? 

3. Growth hacks, If any ?
[01/12/18, 11:02:42 AM] Jeet (pushstart): I dont think uber benefits plus i feel it is legal. 
He convinced driver of uber and that is owner of the car, not neccessarily need to take uber’s permission. 

If thought in right way many such innovative model can come up.
[01/12/18, 11:23:00 AM] Lokesh (pushstart): It was a very interesting article. 😀😀
[01/12/18, 11:28:23 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): 1. 70-80% of uber drivers do not own cars. Sharing economy. Also If they own one, indemnity and red flag clauses do not allow them for promotions. 

2. Why shouldn't uber monetize its resources rather than letting it disposed in an unorganized market ? There is a serious loss of face value of the brand.

But deeply appreciate the enthusiasm in folks and for thinking out of the box. They will also have to structure this process into something that is legit and viable and can be tracked for progress with all stakeholders benefited.
[01/12/18, 11:29:51 AM] Neeraj Joshi: I would agree with this
[01/12/18, 11:30:46 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Only If there would have been an option to differ. 😜😜
[01/12/18, 11:31:18 AM] Shashank Shekhar (Pushstart): Well Uber didn't get anything out of this.

This was a simple case of us being resourceful and utilizing the dead resources.
[01/12/18, 11:31:54 AM] Shashank Shekhar (Pushstart): There have been attempts on advertising with the cabbies. But most of the use cases I researched didn't have a strong CTA or a well placed ad.
[01/12/18, 11:34:43 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I appreciate the process of lateral thinking. Advise would be just to think more on how it could be legit and (arguably) viable.  

In other cases the driver is at a serious threat of loosing an employment as well penalty. Sections will have to be checked with the legal person.
[01/12/18, 11:35:52 AM] Shashank Shekhar (Pushstart): Not really. I digged into this further. There is no threat to the cab driver about this.

Since no mention in their legal contract about the space. Incidentally a lot of Uber drivers in the US have some very innovative ideas to increase their revenues from the rides they offer.

Some have candy jars. Some sell cigarettes and condoms. 🤣
[01/12/18, 11:35:53 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): For an example, sometimes when we take a ride into OLA luxe or prime, It also assures zero advertisement and the cab aggregators charges a stipulated amount more for this..

That person might get offended.
[01/12/18, 11:36:34 AM] Shashank Shekhar (Pushstart): Oh yes. I'll have to probe further about this.

But honestly Uber and Ola is loosing cab drivers. Doesn't make sense for them to fight over this with the cabbies.
[01/12/18, 11:40:15 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Thanks for consideration. 

A quick math : 400 out of 26lakh cars on the streets of bangalore. My concern is when you address even 0.1% of total market size. 😜
[01/12/18, 11:41:04 AM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Instead get things legit and work in an organized structure afterall is the true essence of entrepreneurs.

Then i guess it is dead.

If your own profile suggest using manually for time being and then shift to buffer and other tools.

[19/12/18, 10:56:03 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Hey guys,

I run a graffiti agency called Wicked Broz and from time to time we work with some really interesting artists who come to meet us from other parts of the globe. I thought it would be a nice experiment if they not only explored the streets of Mumbai and painted with our Indian crews but also got to interact with the startup eco-system of the country. Who knows what might come about from there.

Currently we have one such artist from Coquimbo, Chile here with us till 14th Jan. Rikis Santander works and travels in Chile as a graffiti artist and is well known in his city for his masterful works. We first met him in Brazil couple of years at rhe Streets of Style graffiti festival. He is here in India now to meet us and has already painted at the ISBT in Jabalpur Street art festival and for Paint My City campaign happening in Prayagraj.

PM me if someone would like to meet him or if he can be invited to the upcoming Pushmeetups or other startup meets till he is here. He would be happy to interact and see if collaborations are possible.

THINK DEEP!

We are always so STUCK @ managing day-to-day operations that we often forget to take out time and Self-Analyse:
*What are we doing? 
*Why are we doing it?
*Where are we heading towards?

Isn’t it?

When was the last time you took out some time from your BUSY Schedule to THINK?

Maybe its the RIGHT time of the year to take a BREAK, Getaway from your Busy City life and Go on a Self-Exploration Trip to THINK for 2019. 

We @ Pushstart are organising First of its Kind Overnight Trip for YOU ALL to Lonavala this 29th December!

This Trip will be filled with Group Activities, hashtag#PushKnowledge Sessions, Bonfire Talks, BBQ and Nature Exploration.

These activities will be framed in a way that helps you to:
*Discover your Long-term Goals.
*Self-Explore your existing Business Problems.
*Collaborate with like-minded folks to PUSHSTART your journey from 2019.

Want to Join the Trip?
We are running Christmas Deals valid till End of Wednesday!

[28/12/18, 9:23:20 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): #pushHelp

So, out of the pool of many applications of our patented *AI* Framework, the first product we are building is a platform that would automate the entire training process for T & P Department for colleges and HR Agencies and save them millions in the long run, we have letter of intents from organisations and colleges and to support our development what we do is take outside projects and get the cashflow running, but this has slowed us down a lot because of multiple factors. Also, we don’t have any external financing as of now. 

Do you think an investor, angel or vc would be interested to help accelerate our product development?
(Not exactly here looking for money, anyway one could support the development/help get good cashflow would be appreciated.)

#pushThanks
[28/12/18, 9:54:56 PM] Neeraj Tiwari (ps): This is a classic case which many startup face. 

We did too and learned hard way that this type of slow down is actually a death valley. 

Do following

1: Fire all the people who is working on that extra work, including the client. Do not take any project other than your core idea.

2: The college/organisation who has given you the letter of intent ask them Rs 1 Lakh if they can or ask 50% of your project cost or at least 25%. If they are not ready for this. Leave them.  If they are not paying now, they will not pay later or they are not seeing the wow value.

3: if you are founder or anyone more founder, go as lean as you can. Shift to a co-working space you can get good partners.

4: Do not approach any VC or Investor at this stage, no one will invest. Forget about them now and even later. Every VC will come finding you.

5: Try to run the company in Rs 10,000 or less. The reason you are taking extra projects becuase your cost of running company is more.

6: If nothing is working, drop this idea and focus on that additinal work to make more money for 6 months and then reinvest the amount on core idea.

There was a time when I was burning say Rs 100 monthly and was forced to do same what you doing now. I learned the above things from my worst days expereince. Today our monthly burn is less than 10% of our intial burn and we are making more money than we were making at Rs 100. 

Hum entrepreneur apne aap ko bolte rahte hain All is Well, but all is not well. Focus and you will surely find a way to get your product out. Do not go to any investor or financer, it will not help. 

I said something else what you asked for, but sharing my own experience.
[28/12/18, 10:00:16 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I appreciate the message. 

There is only one golden rule in startups to succeed that there is no golden rule. Please refrain any such imprints.

[28/12/18, 10:02:23 PM] Neeraj Tiwari (ps): 100% True.
[28/12/18, 10:09:29 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: I agree with this. My last company we were having trouble raising funds and so we took a side project on, the side project ended up taking all our time and extinguishing the rest of our money-even worse? The side project didn't pay us, last minute there was one excuse after the other. Consequently I had to slowly lay off staff one by one until we had to close eventually.
[28/12/18, 10:18:51 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): So much our case, I guess it’s time
[28/12/18, 10:24:38 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): 1. Focus is of utmost priority. But just because you do not have fuel doesn't mean you'll not do anything else to keep your engine working. 

2. Sometimes you may relate / understand in the later stages that the scope and the idealogy of what you started with changed over a period of time but for good. 

3. All the unicorns, turn their pages back. Look at their MVPs and current execution, you'll know what I'm trying to speak about.
[28/12/18, 10:26:09 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): I've personally known folks both at the funding and the entrepreneur side who quit their hustle and took advises way too seriously. It's a prompt request for each one of us to understand 

What's food for us, could be a poison to someone else.

[03/01/19, 1:07:40 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Needed a small terminology and process clear- About valuation and ask.

Ask is based on Future valuation?

Like if the valuation is INR 10 cr in 2 yrs then the ask now will 2 cr for 20%?

(I was confused while talking to someone. Needed a good clarification)

[03/01/19, 1:50:10 AM] Darshan Bambiru (pushstart): Stake depends on how much founders are ready to let go at what stages... It's mutual or more so conditional at times too

[03/01/19, 5:54:32 AM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: Ask is based on present valuation. But an element of the present valuation is the potential for a future higher valuation or the company's prospects in general. The difficulty here is you cannot put a valuation on the company based on a expected higher future valuation that is dependant on receiving funds in the first place. So in short valuation is an art not a science. However there are some general rules of thumb. So for example the institution founders graduated from is an element also the location of the company because that goes to access to capital. Higher the access higher the valuation generally. Investors rarely invest too geographically far from their home base. This is all from personal experience - been raising funds since 2001 (right after the Dotcom crash).

To arrive at the list, Inc42 filtered the essence of its years of understanding on the Indian startup ecosystem and supplemented it with inputs from both the Inc42 Editorial and Inc42 DataLabs teams, conducting an in-depth review to recognise the 42 most innovative startups in India.

Inc42 has put together the 42Next — a list of the 42 most innovative startups causing an impact in the Indian startup ecosystem.

Check for Mumbai from these per your requirement (whatever it is... 😂)

[19/01/19, 7:06:01 PM] Sushant (Pushstart): If they don't have a bounty program, you might wanna tweet your finding and tag them as well as some other known people of the company. That is one way to get attention I presume. Ask them to DM you if they wanna find out.
[19/01/19, 7:12:53 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): This can be a breaking news, posting a tweet and telling about how JD lacked in securing the data

[19/01/19, 11:13:32 PM] AMIT MISHRA (pushstart): Play this smartly and I personally don't know what you do. Don't look at just a bounty and I know Mani is smart enough to make some decisions..best of luck
[19/01/19, 11:16:03 PM] Nilesh Jain (pushstart): i feel it will only be damage control..he/they might just be ensuring that you dont leak it to the world.
[19/01/19, 11:16:13 PM] Vinay Jain (pushstart): Na not behind bounty. I'm behind "why" such a reputed company, selling enquiries through premium plans would do such a silly mistake that exposes it.
[19/01/19, 11:16:50 PM] Vinay Jain (pushstart): Obviously not .. whatever the scene may be, ethics first always.

There is a lot of confusion around whether to add your friends to FB and then here or the other way around. 

In the past 2 weeks, a lot of pushstarters have reached out to me asking *how to add people in their network to this community?*

It’s pretty simple, just share this form with the interested folks in your network, we will add them here directly after going through their profile once 😋😋

Sounds good? 

Then start sharing this registration form with fellow founders in your network:

[29/01/19, 2:52:05 PM] Neeraj Joshi: Hey Pushstarters, 
From the past 45 days, we have been working towards CURATING our communities across Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru. 

Now its time to CURATE our Community in Mumbai!
[29/01/19, 2:52:27 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Why the CURATION?* 
Our aim @ Pushstart is to build a collaborative ecosystem for YOU to grow YOUR Business by making relevant knowledge and connections accessible to YOU at lightning fast speed! 

We believe that *relevant knowledge* should be accessible to everyone who wants to or is pursuing entrepreneurship and that’s why the *Pushstart FB Group*.  

But

*Relevant CONNECTIONS* should be only accessible to only Genuine Trustworthy people who are pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME.
[29/01/19, 2:53:16 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *What of CURATION* 
We are changing the Entry Criteria and Process to get into this Whatsapp Group. 

*New Criteria:* 
From now on we will allow ONLY and ONLY serious Genuine Entrepreneurs and Ecosystem players who are looking to GROW Venture in this Whatsapp group. 

We have realised that this group won’t create ROI for the ones who are startup enthusiasts and not really pursuing entrepreneurship in REALTIME as of now. 

FB Group would be more relevant for them to learn, pursue entrepreneurship and then become eligible to join this group.
[29/01/19, 2:53:29 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *Process:* 
As we want this to be a highly CURATED and CLOSED community, from now on it is COMPULSORY for everyone to fill this form before becoming part of the community: http://bit.ly/Pushstartform.
[29/01/19, 2:54:19 PM] Neeraj Joshi: *How are we implementing the Change?* 
It's a request from all of you to fill this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform if you want to become part of our New Curated Community of Mumbai. 

The first deadline for form filling will be End of this Thursday. Kindly fill this form latest by day after tomorrow. 

Me and @919819946239 will be spearheading the Change!
[29/01/19, 2:54:46 PM] Neeraj Joshi: This is the first step towards evolving this Community as a Premium offering. 

Will be sharing the whole new version in the near future! 

Hope we make sense here.

Let me know if you have any queries :)
[29/01/19, 2:55:52 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you have filled this form http://bit.ly/Pushstartform. No need to fill it again
[29/01/19, 2:57:49 PM] Neeraj Joshi: If you haven't, its time to *FILL IT NOW*. We will unfortunately have to remove you if your entry is not found in the form

[30/01/19, 2:45:00 PM] Sushant (Pushstart): Heyy guys! 

I along with Pratik Dolas, have started Moving Visions, a Digital In-Store Advertising Platform. 
and placed our first 32" LCD screen in a very prime and busy location, SV Road, Borivali West. 
The place is just opposite Adidas showroom and has 3000-5000 footfalls a day. 

The plan is to offer the virtual space to advertisers for advertising. The cost to advertiser is only 2000 per month. 
The ad slot offered to advertiser is 15 sec, and we guarantee that the ad will be played for at least 80 times per day, for 26 days a month. 

The whole system is controlled by CMS. We just need the image/video/ppt/pdf file from the advertiser. 

*We're looking for advertisers to advertise with us. Please let us know if you are, or if you know anyone.* 

📧: Hello@movingvisions.co

TLDR: Moving Visions, digital Ad platform, is looking for advertisers to advertise their products/services on our 32" LCD Panel.
Cost: 2000+GST per month
Ad Time: 15 sec slot, 
Ad Played: minimum 80 times/day, for 26 days a month. 

Thank you and cheers 🍻

The nature of the framework is that it is meant for operational improvement, so it isn't applicable at a strategic/corporate level, but at daily work processes level, it definitely helped us parse our bottlenecks.

[31/01/19, 9:58:55 AM] Varun Sheth: Box 8 & Faasos too. 
Lots of pivoting. Lots of cash burn. Faasos wants to raise more money to grow from 200-500 stores I believe at a valuation of $400mn. Through trial & error have sort of figured whats working. They say they will finally be profitable this year :P

Extremely challenging business overall. The app war makes things much much worse for restaurateurs.

Bottom line is customers are going to lap up discounts. Cannot be faulted. Brand loyalty & recall is extremely hard to build without a war chest.

[01/02/19, 11:30:33 PM] Abhinav Sankar (ps): Hola Pushstarters!

A digital marketing expert, an entrepreneur but more importantly a Pushstarter ever since its birth- its people like *Zain Siddiqui* that keep us going and take us closer to achieve what we have envisioned. 😎😎

Hailing all the way from Kota for the *PushConnect 10* at *Delhi*, Zain was taken by surprise when Neeraj called him just 2 days ago and requested him to host the event.

Not only did Zain agree, he took the huge responsibility with enthusiasm and spirit. This was clearly reflected in the #PushChat session. Zain's research and questions made the whole event really a *'worth giving time and money'* for event! So much that *Ajay Shrivastava, COO and CTO @ Knowlarity* himself enjoyed the session!🔥🔥

Thanks a lot Zain, you're amazing.🤩🤩

Show him some love by reading his *story and experience* of PushConnect:

.

Rings a bell?? 🤔🤔
.
.
.
Yeah, you're right- It's *#PushQnA.* 😎😎

We're back with an *all new* version of *PushQnA*, starting *next week*.🔥🔥

So what's new?

PushQnA is not just gonna be a QnA session, but in addition to that the host would be sharing *original content* freshly brewed for Pushstarters! 

The content would be shared *3 days prior* to the QnA session and would be *101 themed* pertaining to the topic.

This content is specially for those who are curious about the topic and want to gain some basic knowledge much before the QnA. 

We're excited to begin with the new revamped PushQnA, which would happen *every Tuesday at 9:30 pm* 🤩🤩

Stay Tuned for further updates!!

[08/02/19, 11:12:59 AM] Madhuri Sen (pushstart): One of the most common reason is unauthorized use of copyright material. Another common reason is violation of terms of use, such as spamming other pages - that usually may get one or more admins of the other pages reporting this page. Pages with health related products and services featured face additional policy constraints - much of which is in fine print. Best wait to hear from them what the specific violation has been.

[13/02/19, 5:52:20 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: Yes that's not the same program. That one is not made by mixrosoft
[13/02/19, 5:53:13 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: This is on the windows store but it's another program developed by another developer (not a Microsoft product and no relation to the original ms software)
[13/02/19, 5:54:12 PM] Jason Fernandes (pushstart: And yes I too had it installed and was using it but when when my device had issues i had to reinstall windows I went to dowload it and found a page saying it was discontinued.

[13/02/19, 6:37:57 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): DM'ing thanks
[13/02/19, 8:00:11 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): PushAsk

How to deal with a Tech Company who delayed pur project by 6 months and now asking extra money without any details given? And they have yet not completed the work as discussed in agreement.

He happens to be a pushstarter  Wont take name as of now but if they create issues then I have to go public about this.
I have been really patient about this as he was a Pushstarter too.

But I think such folks need to learn some professionalism.
[13/02/19, 8:10:41 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): If it’s 10-20 days buffer that’s understandable to the max, but you waited for more than a month in excess to the estimated time that itself is bad
[13/02/19, 8:11:21 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): We were stuck as our 40% money was taken as advance
[13/02/19, 8:11:43 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Didn’t you put those in TOC?
[13/02/19, 8:11:57 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): As to if delay happens what will happen etc?
[13/02/19, 8:12:04 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): There is a paycut mentioned for delays!
[13/02/19, 8:12:24 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): And now he is kinda skipping that. knowing the paycut thing.
[13/02/19, 8:13:01 PM] Nayan Khandor (pushstart): yup
[13/02/19, 8:13:35 PM] ‪+91 98920 49589‬: U can  sue the party as per the contract, i am assuming that whatever u had asked for  is delivetable by the com0any
[13/02/19, 8:14:00 PM] ‪+91 98920 49589‬: Are u registered under MSME
[13/02/19, 8:14:48 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yes. And now is charging like. making login is free but forgot password feature is chargeable


I am like dude it's a dumb man thing to even ask for.

We gave them a proper wireframe in Balsamiq
[13/02/19, 8:14:57 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Pvt ltd
[13/02/19, 8:15:42 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Lol 😂 really
[13/02/19, 8:16:01 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I can do the forgot pwd for you in 10 mins man😂😂😂 it’s that easy
[13/02/19, 8:16:08 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: Really don't wanna laugh but can't control .. lol 🤣🤣
[13/02/19, 8:16:25 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): 😂😂😂
[13/02/19, 8:16:36 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Same expression i had
‎[13/02/19, 8:17:03 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): ‎image omitted
[13/02/19, 8:17:23 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): *have handled
[13/02/19, 8:17:31 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): It’s better to go public with his name and say him to give deadline.. as you have already gave more than enough time
[13/02/19, 8:17:43 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Hardly any details. 😨
[13/02/19, 8:17:46 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: +1
[13/02/19, 8:18:30 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yeah.. We are just waiting for final development this week and if they don't complete and handover. We shall go public
[13/02/19, 8:19:39 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): And who doesn't allow to see the backend code during the entirety development durations.

We could hardly see any backed code and now he is like- pay final amount to see the backend code..

I am like Total No No to this kind of People now.. showing new colours
[13/02/19, 8:19:52 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Next time you work with someone, ensure the follow Scrum processes 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)
[13/02/19, 8:20:17 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Thanks. Got my lesson. Didn't had an idea back then.. now will follow
[13/02/19, 8:20:56 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Keep it as a mandate. Any decent development company will be comfortable with it
[13/02/19, 8:21:12 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: Have you checked their capability if they cud deliver  such project? 2. I need to understand other part of the. Story also. U can not clap with one hand. 3. I wud look at the current state and see if it's workable solution..
[13/02/19, 8:21:29 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): 😅😅😅🤘🏼
[13/02/19, 8:21:41 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): As for this case, if they are unable to deliver the product, you have every right to ask for a refund
[13/02/19, 8:21:41 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): Sue them
[13/02/19, 8:22:01 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Don't hold back on this
[13/02/19, 8:22:58 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: BS***
[13/02/19, 8:23:23 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: If a company is accepting a project , that means they are capable of delivering it.
[13/02/19, 8:23:56 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): Better to give him time till this week and if they don’t give you the work, just ask for refund complete. As that would be the best. According to me a Client can’t say every minute things like button etc so it should be understood by the development company
[13/02/19, 8:24:00 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): +1 
The responsibility is on the company, not the client
[13/02/19, 8:24:21 PM] Bharatwaj (ps): I wouldn’t say so, I have seen freelancers posing as company and say that they can do
[13/02/19, 8:24:24 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: Not necessary sir..
[13/02/19, 8:25:18 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: If a company is accepting a project even after knowing that they are not capable of delivering it then it's not a company , it's a scam
[13/02/19, 8:25:31 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: Pm. I can call you in the morning and solve this out.. this is project management than tech project
[13/02/19, 8:25:53 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: That's cruel world u are in.
[13/02/19, 8:26:16 PM] ‪+91 94200 70505‬: A.k.a. *Real World*
[13/02/19, 8:26:49 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yes.

They did show us some websites as their work.

And they claimed to have a 70 member team.

We have our CTO (ex Microsoft guy) coordinating the work

We did discuss all tech stack (my CTO hold good understanding of all tech stacks)

They Initially misled us till our CTO got hold of and then changed the tech stack as per initial discussion and then he got a project manager as this founder hardly know any shit (after my CTO asked him details)..
He says yes to all and now it's all messed. 

We finally are getting a normal MVP site with asked features which hardly takes 1month to develop.

Excuses given- fever, dengue, team issues, X, y, z.... And now being pushy for payment.
(The final development is still pending)
[13/02/19, 8:28:17 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yeah
[13/02/19, 8:28:58 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yes. If they take up anything above from their knowledge be ready to pay..😞
[13/02/19, 9:13:13 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): Interesting, Nikhil. Surprised to know,

1. Why didn't you use ACH(Automatic Clearing House) as the payment mode ?

2. Value of transaction ? Terms of offering was included in the agreement ?

3. Send emails and telephone as a remainder of engagement. And If still not paid, bank factoring karo with invoices.
[13/02/19, 9:26:23 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I did last two things
[13/02/19, 9:27:09 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): This guy is Dikshant Mahant fron Ziasy Technology who is also a relative of Wiityfeed founders
[13/02/19, 9:27:31 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Current pushstarter
[13/02/19, 9:27:35 PM] Jeet (pushstart): ??
[13/02/19, 9:27:37 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yeah...
[13/02/19, 9:28:29 PM] Saurabh Chaudhary (pushstart): This is absurd ... forgot password chargeable 🤣🤣🤣 .
[13/02/19, 9:28:50 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): @919619776461 was also affected by him and we both were stopping forward sake of some time he asked. But now he is way above my level of patience
[13/02/19, 9:29:09 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I have already told Neeraj about this and was being very patient but it's enough
[13/02/19, 9:31:28 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): He had held my Referral commission for a non Pushstarter Referral earlier stating some business losses and now he demands extra payment for this kind of work and delay
[13/02/19, 9:32:59 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): Who is he? At least PM us so we don’t get involved as well 😅
[13/02/19, 9:33:11 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): On a serious note
[13/02/19, 9:36:32 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I have told him the situation and condition of payment release and he is now not responding.
I am doing the final feedback of site for his Project Manager to complete and post completion of the asked work, we can think of any payment as I totally lost trust from this guy.

[13/02/19, 9:40:39 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Well. Firstly I want to understand if he is in the group
[13/02/19, 9:40:45 PM] Sayan Ganguly: This group
[13/02/19, 9:41:08 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): He is not.
[13/02/19, 9:42:10 PM] Sayan Ganguly: He referred a big company for our Digital Media Tender and was behind me forcing me to get that company somehow selected
[13/02/19, 9:44:00 PM] Vineet (pushstart): His stake would be involved
[13/02/19, 9:44:01 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): He heads 2-3 partner companies if I remember
[13/02/19, 9:44:15 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Wittyfeed Parent company included
[13/02/19, 9:45:09 PM] ‪+91 98196 94946‬: Guys we're all discussing one side of the story for long time. I just spoke to dikshant about this. Pls add him in the group and get the clear picture.
[13/02/19, 9:46:08 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Well. If you think so, do bring him in and ask Neeraj and Rushabh too.
[13/02/19, 9:46:18 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I don't have issues
[13/02/19, 9:47:13 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): He is the sala of wittyfeed founder
[13/02/19, 9:47:22 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Also. I just happened to see the issue just now
[13/02/19, 9:47:52 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Do you have dispute and termination clauses in the agreement?
[13/02/19, 9:49:45 PM] Sayan Ganguly: It so happens that issues do arise due to miscommunications
[13/02/19, 9:50:06 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Even being a large enterprise we end up being at the other end
[13/02/19, 9:50:32 PM] Sayan Ganguly: So, before doing character assassination lets have a clear picture
[13/02/19, 9:50:36 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yes. Miscommunication can happen on regular communication. 😅

Which was missing-

Kabhi dengue, Kabhi shaadi, kabhi tech team nai hai ..
[13/02/19, 9:50:58 PM] Sayan Ganguly: These could be genuine also
[13/02/19, 9:51:20 PM] Sayan Ganguly: Sometimes people do take up large projects on self-confidence

[13/02/19, 9:52:54 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): when you claim to have 70 ppl team then this is what you should be ready for.

1 month buffer is also accepted but 5 months  delay?
[13/02/19, 9:53:25 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): there is a paycut as per agreement and we expected the prototype given in balasmiq to be developed as what he agreed upon!
[13/02/19, 9:54:18 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Not a good trait then this is for those people.

[13/02/19, 9:57:11 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I am not defaming any. I am just putting up facts. People are free to decide
[13/02/19, 9:57:44 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): I dont know the entire issue but its wise not to wash the dirty linen in public.. A drycleaner can always sort things out
[13/02/19, 9:57:54 PM] ‪+91 98196 94946‬: I DM you so let's end here
[13/02/19, 9:58:09 PM] ‪+91 98196 94946‬: Exactly👍
[13/02/19, 9:58:21 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): People should know about Experiences..

We have dealt a lot in person already
[13/02/19, 10:00:00 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): Correct dada but first line of response is always get Issues resolved first amicably... give back and social responsibility can be done once ur Issues are resolved.. This way it will be an Ego clash and irrespective of whosoever mistake ..Issue resolution becomes difficult
[13/02/19, 10:00:49 PM] Nilesh (pushstart): As an Entrepreneur I strongly suggest not going to war when winning peacefully is a possible
[13/02/19, 10:02:19 PM] ‪+91 98196 94946‬: In entrepreneurship if you can't make friend dont create enemies also

[13/02/19, 10:06:32 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I will send you a voice note.
I have kept this issue postponed for 2-3 months before going public..

I do have a decent understanding of business and reputation and in no case I wanted this to go public until I see the right time.
[13/02/19, 10:10:35 PM] Batman (pushstart): As per this, you can actually charge the person on the late fees for non delivery from 20th Sept onwards.
[13/02/19, 10:10:39 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): 😅
[13/02/19, 10:12:08 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: What u talking about? Customer is fuxxxking first priority. I HV seen ppl committed, don't go their own marriage itself😃😃😃
[13/02/19, 10:13:01 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Exactly. And If I do, I think he might have to pay me😅
[13/02/19, 10:13:21 PM] Jeet (pushstart): The best thing is due date is september and it is february. 
If the product isnt delivered that means Developer is at fault.
[13/02/19, 10:13:35 PM] Giri Malpani (pushstart): This is not invoice. Company credentials ? Deal kyun kiya ?
[13/02/19, 10:13:45 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I did that so many times... Customer handing is 1st priority
[13/02/19, 10:13:51 PM] Jeet (pushstart): There cannot be any story from his side.

[13/02/19, 10:15:46 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): I still can say the same.. As If I take the customer I ensure that his work is done or I have prior talks with him that there will be a delay.
I handle around 3 calls a day now also.
[13/02/19, 10:16:02 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): See this.. GST hi nai hai..

[13/02/19, 10:24:37 PM] Rahul Gupta (ps): ??
Invoice must have the following mandatory fields:
Invoice number and date.
Customer name.
Shipping and / or billing address.
Customer and taxpayer's GSTIN (if registered)**
Place of supply.
HSN code/ SAC code.
Item details i.e. description, quantity (number), unit (meter, kg etc.), total value.
Taxable value and discounts.

Else don’t pay against that, you are in a scam.
[13/02/19, 10:25:10 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yes. we wont pay as of now, until things get clear, legal and in proper way
[13/02/19, 10:28:30 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: U have paid against what? U paid 40% right?
[13/02/19, 10:28:47 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Advance for development.
[13/02/19, 10:29:09 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: On invoice like this?

[13/02/19, 10:30:33 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): There was no invoice given of that yet..

[13/02/19, 10:33:11 PM] Vineet (pushstart): I agree... And I think.. He will deliver crap.. Take it from a Non Techhie working in a Tech company
[13/02/19, 10:35:21 PM] Vineet (pushstart): You Go Legal way.. If you have the infrastructure to support it.. Otherwise.. ₹46k ke badle lakhon rupaye jayenge.. And time will also go down the drain.. One idea could be find other customers who were cheated by him and file something like a Class Action suit.
[13/02/19, 10:37:57 PM] Batman (pushstart): agree. If you need legal help, can extend my team for that.
[13/02/19, 10:38:08 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Class action suit ka kya fayda?

Konsi fortune 500 firm hai
[13/02/19, 10:38:37 PM] Jeet (pushstart): Liquidation value zero hai. So no point doing any suit.
[13/02/19, 10:39:24 PM] Vineet (pushstart): I was thinking the same.. But wanted to share the idea
[13/02/19, 10:39:25 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Well. I am still resolving as else atleast i would ensure that this Experience of mine goes to 12k Pushstarter and 20k linkeie diya followers and 5k fb friends and 3.5k Twitter Folks.

[13/02/19, 10:40:34 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Indeed wittyfeed will be publicly dragged to show that this guy is using their relationship to show the reputation in a wrong way
[13/02/19, 10:40:45 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Anyway. @918953881643  fire the vendor and ask for a refund. Period.

[13/02/19, 10:42:02 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): Itna... yeah public power thing...is like a "political party" sort off behavior.
[13/02/19, 10:43:47 PM] Harshal (Pushstart): I agree to someone who wrote...don't make enimies jibe.

Or better yet pay them a visit in office and SORT it. 

This fourm seems to a futile place, unless you have a fixed action u want to take
[13/02/19, 10:43:56 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Oh yeah.. ab toh woh bhi kaafi amiguity me hai
[13/02/19, 10:44:32 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Yeah, lets end the conversation here.

[14/02/19, 5:30:29 AM] ‪+91 98196 94946‬: Hi guys, i am Dikshant Mahant, the guy who has been in news in this group since last few hours. I am one of the founder of Ziasy technologies, the startup which started its journey with content marketing and software development and irony is we have also become victim of false social media stories. 
I am not a graduate from IITs/ NITs, neither i have worked with any of the MNCs, but, i have intent to learn new technologies and serve the clients. We may be running our firm from a tier two city but our dreams have no boundaries.
When we started, Nikhil supported us in getting clients and in return of that he was charging 10% for business development or client connect. After few clients, he requested us to develop a website for him and his friends in US. An agreement was signed between parties and scope of work is clearly defined in that. Now, when we completed the scope of work as per agreement and raised the invoice, Nikhil is pushing us for additional work. In response we have requested him to release the payment of the work performed, to which he got irritated and started threatening us that if we will not finish the additional work, he won’t shell out a single penny. 
We understand that he may not like the quality of the work performed, he may not like the invoice we created or he may not like us asking for money for the work we performed, but all these can be discussed and resolved professionally, if your intent is right. 
The point we would want to make is please don’t believe in the false stories created by someone whose intent is just to defame others. At least understand both sides of stories and take informed decision. 
Also, we may not be pro in creating invoices but we believe in taking the feedback constructively and would not let you down in our future invoices.
From,
Dikshant Mahant,
Dreamer & Believer

[14/02/19, 8:17:20 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Great. In September the work was supposed to be done. And till now we have got this as completed work.

People are free to look at this website and decide if it's worth 60k INR and if it looks complete?

https://warm-inlet-93009.herokuapp.com/home

https://warm-inlet-93009.herokuapp.com/courses

https://warm-inlet-93009.herokuapp.com/plansandpricing

He *still have not given* the commission amount that he claims I am charging. INR 20k is still pending.

He is the one who gives this as site at the very 1st time and upon asking for improvement , makes nuisance and being pushy for final payment.

Our team has never gotten a chance to see the back end of the website at all. (we are highly doubtful about codes developed at his end)
[14/02/19, 8:22:26 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Too much of emotional drama of tier 2. 

I am a person who have donated money for Free and have helped people get clients by taking a personal Effort too.

I charge commission for the time I Invest.

He still isn't in mood to pay me the commission of the ONGC head i have gotten him for their project.

I still told him to pay me commission once his Financial situation gets stable (as he was the one begging for time to pay back)

Pls if someone falling for such stories, God help them.

I have the prototype file all of Balsamiq who's less then 60% of work is done

We asked for a calling feature in that and slot booking feature for mentor & mentee which is even there on our current site and nothing is built yet.

For this site as shown above do you think paying 60k and additional 10k (for that forgot password like features as he claims as additional work)?
[14/02/19, 8:23:37 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): See the timelines as discussed in the agreement which clearly shows September 24, 2018 the project has to be delivered.we still got because of his big & ambitious promises which he never fulfilled.

This is not any court of law wherein u need to  produce all such things, please resolve it mutually with whoever u have ot u may wish tocease any business relatiosnhip with such person. Entirely ur choice. So please no more proofs and counter proofs
[14/02/19, 9:02:22 AM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Sure. I understand. Just making people aware of the guy.

Sorry to all members if this discussion have bugged anyone of you.

I will do what is in good sense of an ethical business and try to resolve this in polite way (and if things go wrong, will write a blog about Experience)

Thanks for listening to me.
[14/02/19, 9:45:28 AM] Vineet (pushstart): Looking from an independent angle... The timelines have not been adhered to.. Delays haven't been explained.. And the product is not ready and no explanation have been given for the same.. So the Agency taking up this work is at fault on multiple counts..  We all take chances.. This one is a lesson for all of us.. And we will still take and give chances.. The only point being.. Where to put the Hard Stop.. All The Best guys...

[16/02/19, 12:11:46 PM] Harsha MV (pushstart): Dear Harsha,

I have been into multiple positions over the past years and currently working as a Product Manager. I am responsible for delivering custom social media platform for clients 

Prior to that I was running my own IT company and delivering web and mobile application solutions to clients worldwide.

For a short period of time I worked as CTO for a magazine called Maggcom where I explored my skills into digital marketing and content writing and we delivered a globally viral campaign #Dontmancriminate 

As I mentioned, I am looking for an organisation where I can put in my heart and soul to efficiently and positively apply my experience to enhance overall processes in the organization and effectively contribute towards the growth of the company.

I intend to grow personally and professionally alongside everyone else and in the process establish meaningful, productive relations that last for a very very long time.

I look forward to taking this conversation forward and explore the possibilities

For a service based venture with initial focus on Indian customers and later global, what you recommend as a website extension, "something.in" OR "something.com" ?? Any rational ??
[20/02/19, 12:33:59 PM] Saurabh: if the 'dot com' domain is available, that will always be the preferred default - not for any specific rational reasons, but because of the human perceptions
[20/02/19, 12:36:09 PM] Hasan Sunara (pushstart): Thanks Saurabh,  I am looking for some insight on how customers may look at it , within India and abroad, does it matter customer acquisition standpoint?
[20/02/19, 12:36:37 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: I have a little diff view here. As u are specific to India. Do use .in as it will be close to ur customer. As u go global, use .com. having said that, buy both of them now before somebody buys  it and then asks for handsome money to transfer it to you.
[20/02/19, 12:39:21 PM] Amit Jhunjhunwala (pushstart): Merger 

But as separate entity

Let them talk and put a list of options on the table. You should make it clear that you will consider these and more options, and will get back post consultation with other stakeholders
[20/02/19, 2:06:32 PM] Pratyaksh Rawat (pushstart): Don't try to close th deal today itself. Shows weakness

[23/02/19, 10:44:52 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Name is nice as nature's secret...u should target offline on wellness store ..dietician ..nutritionist ..organic store and retail chain
[23/02/19, 10:44:55 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: We will have to use ur oil first.
[23/02/19, 10:46:28 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): Is it a plastic bottle or a glass
[23/02/19, 10:46:41 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Little more to add 

I am one of the director in an FPO (farmer producer organisation)
We are producing residue free pomegranates n veggies 

I am working on aquaponics too on my own farm

And working on 2 other social impact startups 🙏
[23/02/19, 10:46:44 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Plastic hai sir
[23/02/19, 10:46:54 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: 🙏🙏
[23/02/19, 10:47:02 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Any time
[23/02/19, 10:47:15 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): Ohh ok
[23/02/19, 10:47:29 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Yes its plastic 

Glass bottle becomes tough for transport
[23/02/19, 10:47:41 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): And expensive also
[23/02/19, 10:48:10 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Yes absolutely true 

 N more vulnerable to break down too
[23/02/19, 10:48:26 PM] Gaurang Desai (pushstart): I guess it can be managed, I have a friend who is into similar kind of products
[23/02/19, 10:49:13 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): I have sell such products in my job
[23/02/19, 10:49:22 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Hence knew how it sell
[23/02/19, 10:49:37 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Cool 

Give me some tips
[23/02/19, 10:52:01 PM] Neeraj Joshi: What’s the process? Cold pressing? Can you elaborate?
[23/02/19, 10:52:18 PM] Neeraj Joshi: How do you plan to scale it? I have heard it is difficult to scale
[23/02/19, 10:53:46 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Sure 

Usual oils are made from metal churners at very high speed n hence under high temperature,  due to which oil looses its all essential nutrients 

Cold pressed is produced using wooden churners and at very slow speed with as close to no temperature
[23/02/19, 10:54:10 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Not really
[23/02/19, 10:56:13 PM] ‎Bhavik (pushstart) added ‪+91 87799 57247‬
[23/02/19, 10:56:28 PM] Bhavik (pushstart): @918779957247 Welcome to Pushstart community, please introduce yourself
[23/02/19, 10:58:33 PM] Yogesh Kothiya (pushstart): That's good but consumer really don't know that 😔 at least I didn't know about it till now.
[23/02/19, 11:00:20 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: I agree 

U r rite 

But now consumers are getting more and more updates with time and diseases like heart attack majorly which causes due to bad refined oils which we consume daily
[23/02/19, 11:00:43 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: This is the replacement for those refined oils we use daily
[23/02/19, 11:03:10 PM] Karmesh(pushstart): Hi ...need help on email marketing. Any MailChimp (any other service provider) expert here? Please PM me.. thank you
[23/02/19, 11:05:08 PM] Rohit Mahind (ps): Wooden oil is what basically our ancestors were using... That's more scientific than the modern processed oil
[23/02/19, 11:05:54 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Absolutely bang on @919970166606 👏👏👏
[23/02/19, 11:07:18 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Processed oil is actually inviting most of the diseases in our lives which are mixed with palm oils to gain more profits 

Palm is the cheapest oil
[23/02/19, 11:07:56 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Small video and photos of those explanation can be good for your marketing.
[23/02/19, 11:08:10 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Yes definitely
[23/02/19, 11:08:37 PM] Nirav Hingu (ps): Not difficult neeraj ...need good sales team and manager with proper strategies capture market
[23/02/19, 11:08:49 PM] Rohit Mahind (ps): Temperature is what is the most important thing while processing any oil. In wooden process, it's maintaned properly.
[23/02/19, 11:09:16 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): Investing on those a bit can help you get long term loyal customers


Play with psychology of health conscious people✌
[23/02/19, 11:09:49 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: Yes true 

 Because of 
1. Wooden churners 
2. Extremely Slow process 
3. Only 14 RMP ( rotation per minute )
[23/02/19, 11:10:11 PM] ‪+91 98206 36453‬: 🙏🙏👍👍👍 perfectly said
[23/02/19, 11:11:31 PM] Nikhil (Pushstart): And soon hopefully we could be able to bring Bio-plastics based containers for those products.

[27/02/19, 10:22:46 PM] Rohit Mahind (ps): Pvt. Ltd co. is better if business has High amount of loan / planning to take the same. Because in sole prop., liability of a business means liability of a proprietor. While in case of a pvt Ltd company, liability belongs to the Company, not to the owner.  

Also, if you have good amount of employees, pvt Ltd company is good.

Sole prop. cannot get equity funding.

[01/03/19, 11:51:39 AM] ‪+91 90290 68247‬: Thanks for your warm welcome, @919819946239. 

Greetings everyone! 
I am Junaid Ansari,  co-founder of Draftss.com - An unlimited graphic design & code service on monthly subscription.

I am looking forward to learn more about marketing & growth to improve our productized service.

Let's connect
[01/03/19, 1:16:47 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): Good afternoon guys,

Looking to connect with tech companies in the US for a product partnership. Any references, please connect. 

Thanks
[01/03/19, 1:18:44 PM] ‪+91 93200 98133‬: What kinda product?
[01/03/19, 1:21:22 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): It's a machine learning based data entry automation tool 

You can check out the website here: documint.ai
[01/03/19, 1:24:46 PM] Shrijit (Pushstart): The US government has released a mandate which makes it necessary for companies and institutions to manage data on the cloud. 

This brings in a huge requirement for data entry automation. We're one of the handful of companies, if not the only one, that have cracked 100% accuracy with both templatized and non templatized data 

Hence looking to partner with tech firms in the US who can help us sell this

[08/03/19, 11:53:45 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): Hey everyone, first of all a very happy women's day! I run Wicked Broz, a graffiti company. I want to announce something big I'm doing with Wicked Broz by the end of this month. Hope some of you feel it's a just cause and come forward to help us out.
[08/03/19, 11:54:01 AM] Zain Siddiqui (pushstart): In January of this year, we undertook a week long trip across Rajasthan upto Agra with a couple of friends from around the world. There was Rikis Santander, a street artist from Chile and Abigail Aroha Jensen, a contemporary artist from New Zealand. We all went mad clicking epic pictures of each other in every pose one can think of at the forts, in the palaces and all over the streets. And the compelling stories of those places made it all the more epic. However, something hit us a few days after this magical trip was over. 
Rikis said two things about the gullies of India - one, they are so crowded (no surprise) and two, there are very few women in this crowd. 

Now that’s not something we didn’t know before. We’ve seen it all our lives. And we even know why it is so!
But maybe that’s why this statement coming from a foreigner missiled into our brain. 
Why? Why is our country so fucked up? 

So we took Rikis’ observation back to Marol, the home of the Wicked Broz, where we’d been planning a hip hop festival for months. Now, we had a new meaning to it. 

Ladies First is a women-led street art festival. The first of its kind in India. Our endeavour is to promote women street artists and in turn bring more women to the streets in India. Back to the basics, dude! Represent. Hip-hop. 

For the first version of our festival that’s going to be held from 25 Mar to 31 Mar, 7 brilliant female artists have come together - 

Anpu, a well known name in the Indian Street Art scene who’s signature cat stencil is always a delight to spot. 
Sam Sam, a part of the first wave of graffiti artists in India who’s been at it for almost a decade now. 
Avantika Mathur, who’s bringing all the boho vibes with her wherever she goes and using surrealism to convey her truth. 
Shirin Shaikh, a solo traveler who’s heart and art are both closest to nature. 
Kesar Khinvasara, the goddess of mandalas whose inspiration comes from the most basic element of drawing - a line. 
Ratna Singh, whose style is all about bringing Warli art to the walls of the world. 
And Abigail Aroha Jensen (yes, the same one we mentioned before), whose fresh, modern style has been a part of the first transgender art fest in Prayagraj. 

All of us together hope to bring more power to the women on the streets, way beyond the walls of Marol and Mumbai. 

What else we hope to do is to bring together leading figures in Indian Street art to come and speak about women, art and their experiences. If you want to simply pick up a brush and get moving, we have through street art workshops for you too! 
And if you want to just come check out the scene and learn a little about where it all comes from, we’ve got screenings and graffiti tours for you to show how art has been taking over the streets for the last few years. 

Wicked Broz has sprung from hip-hop. We can never forget that. So in spirit of that, we’ll also be hosting a cypher on the last day of the festival calling out all b-girls and female rappers! 

Through Ladies First we hope to change the gender representation and inclusion in the scene a little bit, to push the needle against what is considered taboo. You see, nothing is a waste of time ladies and gentleman! 
Shaitani bina bachpan choro, zindagi bekar hai dude. 

If you want to join our movement as a volunteer/ collaborator/ partner/ sponsor, reach out to us at 8887795823 or email us ladiesfirststreetart@gmail.com/zain@wickedbroz.com. 

See you at the streets!
